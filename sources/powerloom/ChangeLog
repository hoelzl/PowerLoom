Update of /nfs/image2/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/logic
In directory redhouse:/home/hans/Projects/powerloom/sources/logic

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
TRUTH-VALUE:
  Added `polarity' and `strength' slots so predicates like `true?'
  can be more informed when called with truth values that are
  different than the standard truth value constants (this is not used
  yet but might be once we attach justifications).

assign-truth-value:
  Handle new INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE.  Once a proposition is
  inconsistent, it cannot be assigned any other truth value until it has
  been explicitly retracted via `deassign-truth-value'.
  Fix handling of built-in proposition constants, so we can't
  accidentally assing a truth value to them (e.g., via (assert (or))).

deassign-truth-value:
  Handle new :RETRACT-INCONSISTENT update mode.

TRUE-TRUTH-VALUE TRUTH-VALUE, FALSE-TRUTH-VALUE,
DEFAULT-TRUE-TRUTH-VALUE, DEFAULT-FALSE-TRUTH-VALUE,
UNKNOWN-TRUTH-VALUE:
  Initialize new `polarity' and `strength' slots.
  Folded in initialization of `positive-score' (not sure anymore why
  this was done in separate startup code before).

INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE:
  New truth value to flag inconsistent propositions.

true?, false?:
  Fixed handling of non-standard truth-values.  Before that was
  strictly done based on `positive-score' which caused problems with the
  new INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE (and is simply wrong anyway).

unknown?:
  Now subsumes `inconsistent?'.

inconsistent?, inconsistent-truth-value?:
  New predicates.

conjoin-truth-values, invert-truth-value, print-truth-value:
  Handle new INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE.

signal-truth-value-clash:
  Now assigns the INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE to avoid any further
  propagation from it.

unbind-skolem-value:
  Fixed: break the skolem-value link before we look for the equating
  proposition, otherwise we might pick the wrong one from a function
  proposition that has the same value.  Fixes retraction problem of function
  propositions that share their value with others.

find-equating-proposition:
  Streamlined the search for a backlinked object, since the search
  loop would never execute anyway.  What the loop was trying to
  achieve was to find the innermost skolem that points to the non-logic
  object, but the way it was written that would never occur.
  Rethink this, not sure this is really needed.

check-type?:
  Robustfied by checking for a NULL object.

unassert:
  Fixed, generalized: now returns the list of affected propositions
  just like `retract' and does the right thing for function propositions.
  Now also lets one unassert inconsistent propositions.

unassert-proposition:
  Renamed from `unassert-fact'.
  Now properly handles function propositions and inconsistent
  propositions.

Modified Files:
	specialists.ste 
Log Message:
MEMBER-OF-evaluator:
  Fixed: make sure the evaluated proposition is actually true.
  Improved: now checks membership assertions to an enumerated set to
  make sure the assertion is not contradictory.  If it is, it signals a
  clash.  For example, the following proposition now causes a clash:

        (member-of pink (setof red green blue))

  This fixes a bug with missing clashes for assertions to concepts
  that were defined via explicit enumeration.

ask, retrieve:
  Improved documentation.

s-ask, s-retrieve:
  Improved documentation.
  Fixed: make sure we read the arguments in the proper module.
  Eliminated DWIM-ing of extra level of parentheses.  Now we expect
  all arguments to be at the top level, i.e., without a surrounding set
  of parentheses.  This is since we can't really reliably intuit
  whether to drop them or not without doing some more extensive
  parsing (especially true for `s-retrieve').  One way to look at this
  is that for the `s-...' versions the string quotes play the role of
  the surrounding parentheses.

Modified Files:
	strategies.ste 
Log Message:
*pl-anonymous-module*:
  New variable.

create-anonymous-instance:
  New function.

create-hypothesized-instance:
  Replaces `create-hypothesized-skolem'.  The main difference (besides
  putting the name into a separate module) is that this creates an
  instance instead of a skolem.  This solves a problem in case we are
  instantiating a class that generates a rule for each of its
  instances.  Example:

        (defconcept dicot (?dicot angiosperm)
	    :<=> (AND (cardinality (fillers cotyledon-of ?dicot) 2)
		      (forall ?l (=> (AND (leaf ?l)
					  (leaf-of ?dicot ?l))
				     (netted-vein-leaf ?l)))
                      ....))

  The problem with that was that the rule was instantiated with a
  skolem (the anonymous instance) which in turn tripped us up during
  generation of satellite rules which called `generate' somewhere
  along the way to find a duplicate description.  This new mechanism
  doesn't really change the result, but it avoids the warning and any
  other problems we might experience with skolems.  Hypothetical
  instances aren't really skolems, they are not anonymous in the
  hypothetical context, only outside.

try-universal-introduction-proof:
  Use improved `create-hypothesized-instance' instead of
  `create-hypothesized-skolem' (which see).

  canonicalization this would now have to handled by

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
Eliminated canonicalization of proposition CONS-trees, since it
duplicates functionality of `normalize-proposition', doesn't save
much/anything and caused some bugs.  In particular, it caused problems
with implication rules that were wrapped with ABOUT to indicate
direction.  For example, the following was translated incorrectly:

   (=>> (foo ?x ?y) (and (bar ?x) (bar ?y) (fum ?x ?y)))

When the rule was canonicalized into

   (=> (foo ?x ?y) (and (bar ?x) (bar ?y))
   (=> (foo ?x ?y) (fum ?x ?y))

the ABOUT annotation was not properly propagated.  Also, the
canonicalization wasn't done properly, otherwise we would have had
three rules.  Fixing this here was the wrong place; eliminating it
alltogether was the way to go - we hope.

remove-true-and-false, flatten-nested-operators,
canonicalize-and-or-tree, canonicalize-negation-tree,
all-variables-goal?, equal-arguments?, explode-forall-tree,
canonicalize-quantification-tree, CONS.canonicalize-proposition-tree:
  Removed.

quantifier-symbol?:
  Replaced by `kif-quantifier-symbol?' in kif-in.ste.

canonicalize-proposition-tree:
  Made into a dummy place-holder in case we want to resurrect some of
  this.

Log Message:
destroy-all-inference-caches:
  New function.

handle-out-of-date-inference-cache:
  Propagate destruction of a JIT cache to all submodules, since
  inferences were also inherited down and need to be retracted there.
  This caused various problems with `edb' information
  assertion/retraction in KOJAK.
  This also needs to be revisited when the whole cache mess gets
  cleaned up.

help-select-relation-propositions:

select-relation-propositions:
  Now memoized for performance reasons.  This significantly speeds up
  data-intensive queries such as the EELD benchmark used in COGENT where
  we spend 70% of the query time in here:
  - improved CPU time spent from 15min to 5min
  - increased GC time spent from 5.5min to 6.5min

Log Message:
check-strict-type?:
  Fixed similar to `try-isa-proposition-proof' to not fail on literals with
  complex types such as `(my-favorite-int 42)'.

coerce-incompatible-value:
  Fixed: Handle logic-wrappers with types asserted about them, e.g.,
  `(myint 42)'.  This isn't really a proper coercion, but we need to
  make sure that the coerced value winds up in the proposition, e.g., in
  query expressions.

verify-forall-propositions:
  Improved printing of error message (maybe some of this special
  machinery should be moved into the general printing macros - if they
  aren't already).

evaluate-FUNCTION-term:
  Normalize argument order of sets to pick up duplicates.

deleted-proposition?:
  Performance fix: hand-inline `deleted?', since this is called often
  in `select-relation-propositions'.

clear-caches, reset-powerloom:
  New commands.

logic-form-less?:
  Improved to handle unbound function terms - surfaced with sorting of
  SETOF propositions.

Modified Files:

Log Message:
map-and-enqueue-variable:
  Eliminated safety check to allow bound relation variables such
  as `?county/LA' which are the result of equality constraints between a
  relation variable and a constant or other variable; we ignore the
  binding here and rely on the existence of the appropriate equivalence
  proposition to establish the equivalence during inheritance and
  generate a clash if necessary.  This allows us to now appropriately
  forward-chain relation rules like the following during a subsumption test:

(defrelation r2 ((?point_id GEO) (?county_id GEO) (?taz GEO)) :<=>
  (and 
   (geoPartOf ?point_id ?taz)
   (geoPartOf ?taz ?county_id)
   (= ?county_id g_LA)
   ))

  Here `?county_id' is bound to `g_LA' and during subsumption gets
  further equated with the hypothesized skolem for the second argument.
  Before this set of fixes the equality proposition didn't survive
  which prevented us from getting the necessary equivalence.
  Since the safety level was 3, we didn't break and didn't see this
  problem.

  New function derived from `equate-and-simplify-forall-argument'

  passed to `tighten-argument-bindings'.  This in turn makes some
  equivalence propositions survive that previously were eliminated.
  Having these around is important during forward inference that's run
  as part of relation subsumption where a relation argument is bound to
  a constant.  With the equality we now get the equivalence between the
  hypothetical individual and the constant which previously was missed.
  This is part of a set of fixes to fix the ARGOS relation subsumption
  problem.

derive-satellite-rules:

Log Message:
create-anonymous-instance:
  Generalized to generate a regular instance or a skolem.

create-hypothesized-instance:
  We use skolems here to avoid unintentional clashes upon assertion due
  to the unique names assumption.  This could happen, for example, with
  a definition such as the following:
    (defconcept c (?x) :<=> (= ?x the-only-member))
  Now, if we make a hypothetical assertion such as
    (c anonymous-123)
  we would get a clash if `anonymous-123' were a normal object.  Using
  a skolem avoids this problem, since it can be equated to other objects.
  When we make such a hypothetical assertion we say "assume `(c anonymous-123)'
  is true", therefore, we don't want to make this assertion in a way
  that can't be true due to a UNA clash.

Modified Files:

Log Message:
generate-skolem:
  Improved to handle concept prototypes.  This function can cause
  warnings when forward-inferred rules contain skolems (e.g., during
  classification) and the new rule (or description) is checked for
  verbatim equivalents based on the printed representation (see
  descriptions.ste).
  Eventually, this should be fully generalized to also generate
  expressions that can regenerate an arbitrary skolem if necessary
  (see inline comments).

Modified Files:
	descriptions.ste 
Log Message:
ENTITY-MAPPING:
  Doc fix.  With the improved machinery for defined types, we can now
  substitute a different dictionary type here (e.g., KEY-VALUE-MAP) if
  necessary.

equivalent-formulae?:
  Added the reverse lookup here for variables that are mapped onto
  each other in `mapping'.  This wasn't triggered by any bug but by an
  attempt to generalize our equivalence test to not fail if quantified
  variables are supplied in different orders.  To fully generalize
  this more work needs to be done - later.

same-arguments?:
  Changed into `same-and-unique-arguments?' which now additionally
  checks that there are no duplicate variables in the two vectors.

find-duplicate-named-description:
  Now uses `same-and-unique-arguments?' to not pick up a named
  description by mistake if we have duplicate variables.  For example,
  `(kappa (?x ?y) (and (r ?x ?y) (= ?x ?y)))' becomes
  `(kappa (?x ?x) (r ?x ?x)' which is not the same as `r'.

*stringified-description-index*, deleted-logic-object?,
uniquify-description-variables, restore-description-variable-names,
cons-tree-less-than?, sort-proposition-clauses,
uniquify-proposition-tree, help-collect-constant-references,
collect-constant-description-references,
find-duplicate-description-with-constant-reference:
  Removed, since we totally revamped the lookup of duplicate
  descriptions.

find-exact-duplicate-description:
  Changed into `find-duplicate-complex-description' which uses the new
  structured objects index to find duplicates.
  This new version eliminates some "don't know how to generate
  skolem" warnings in the test-suite, because we don't stringify
  anymore.

find-duplicate-description:
  Streamlined with help of new `find-duplicate-complex-description'.

Totally revampled normalization of top-level equivalences, to avoid
fastening down before we do that.  Otherwise, an already fastened-down
description/rule which has already been stored in the new object index
could be destructively modified by this further normalization which
would then prevent us to find duplicates later.

collapse-value-of-chains-for-io-variables:
  Now called by new 'normalize-top-level-descriptive-proposition'.
  Minorly streamlined.

collapse-value-of-chains:
  Removed, since now obsolete.

tighten-argument-bindings:
  Now avoids the unfastening/fastening which might put a copy of the
  proposition into the structured object index and then further
  destructively modify it.
  This should probably go into normalize.ste

equate-top-level-equivalences:
  Simply moved to where it belongs.
  This should probably go into normalize.ste

finish-building-description:
  Use new `normalize-top-level' which will do the simplification of
  variable chains without fastening, so the duplicate check that comes
  later will find duplicates if there are any.
  Slightly stream-lined duplicate check.

evaluate-DESCRIPTION-term:
  Stream-lined duplicate check.

collect-free-variables:
  Fixed: this now collects free variables in the order they are
  encountered which is relied upon by `create-forward-chaining-index'.

Modified Files:
	optimize.ste 
Log Message:
argument-bound?:
  Now calls the slightly more expensive `quantified-argument-bound?'
  if necessary, to not report a quantified variable as unbound.

quantified-argument-bound?:
  Just like `argument-bound?' but also considers quantified variables
  introduced by quantified argument propositions.
  Having the separate version saves the extra complexity for the
  far less common case.

mapped-value-of:
  Fixed to not break on internal variables of KAPPA's when we see
  a parent query iterator (I think this fixes the problem with
  calling `subset-of' on KAPPA's, but I forgot now).

inherit-proposition-argument:
  Properly coerce STELLA relations to their logic descriptions.

inherit-proposition:
  Don't call `find-similar-proposition' anymore since we don't really
  seem to need it and it now causes a bug with some of the PSYASE
  translation stuff due to improved normalization.  In general, calling
  `find-similar-proposition' seems primarily an "optimization"
  that avoids generating duplicate propositions; however, since
  we've improved our duplicate detection machinery, we might want
  to eliminate it alltogether, since it is an expensive function,
  particularly, if we have high-fanout backlinks.

inherit-as-top-level-proposition:
  Use new `normalize-top-level-proposition'.

map-and-enqueue-variable?:
  Now returns TRUE if the mapping was successful or FALSE if there was
  a clash.  Now checks for a potential clash, since if we have
  non-unique io-variables (due to collapsed identity constraints),
  we need to ensure that we are not violating a previous binding.
  Handles rules like this: (=>> (and (= ?x ?y) (r1 ?x ?y)) (r2 ?x ?y))
  - see test-suite "FORWARD INFERENCE BUG"

map-functional-value?:
  Now returns TRUE if the mapping was successful or FALSE if there was
  clash (just passes through the result of `map-and-enqueue-variable?').

inherit-description-propositions:
  Exploit new return values of `map-and-enqueue-variable?' and
  `map-functional-value?'.

  New function to trace application of a forward rule (see above).

apply-forward-rules-to-vector:
  Improved interaction between backward inference tracing and the
  backward inference triggered for cases where we have complex forward
  rules.  If we are not tracing forward inference but backward goal
  tracing is on, turn it off temporarily since the output can be
  distracting.

evaluate-FUNCTION-proposition:
  If we have a computed value in description mode (e.g., when a
  description gets finalized), make sure we substitute a surrogate if
  appropriate to avoid a backlink from the computed object to the
  description.

Update of /home/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/logic
In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv7100

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
LOGIC-OBJECT.dependent-descriptions:
  Removed this kludge, since the new mechanism for finding duplicates
  of complex descriptions doesn't need this anymore.

{LOGIC-OBJECT, PROPOSITION}.home-context:
  Add initializer to always allocate objects in modules rather than
  the current context.  Otherwise, objects can be allocated in
  volatile inference worlds and destroyed when those worlds are
  destroyed.  In some cases this is desirable as a clean-up
  operation, however, there are others where this can lead to very
  strange and difficult to debug bugs.  So, for now we always create
  objects at the module level, and the only thing that changes in
  inference worlds is assertion status.  If cleanup is required it can
  be done manually, or by introducing a separate inference module that
  gets explicitly cleared in regular intervals.

variable?:
  Robustified to also handle NULL objects.

*stringified-proposition-index*, find-exact-duplicate-proposition:
  Eliminated in favor of new duplicate detection scheme.

*structured-objects-index*, cleanup-structured-objects-index,
proposition-hash-index, find-duplicate-complex-proposition:
  New definitions to support new duplicate detection scheme for
  propositions and descriptions (see file for more info).

find-duplicate-proposition:
  Now use `find-duplicate-complex-proposition' to find/store all
  propositions (not just complex ones).

help-fasten-down-propositions:
  For :FORALL and :EXISTS propositions don't try to structure-share
  their arguments, since later simplification or other destructive
  modification could screw things up too easily and create very
  strange bugs.

build-top-level-proposition:
  Use new `normalize-top-level-proposition' for normalization.

build-and-or-not-proposition:
  Catch empty NOT proposition and signal error.

verify-forall-propositions:
  Downgraded error to a warning, since in some cases with
  equivalences and normalization such quantification can occur and
  make sense.

find-duplicate-function-proposition:
  Simplified, since the new `find-duplicate-proposition' handles
  function propositions as well.

deleted-proposition?:
  Commented the complex logic that further deletes the proposition in
  case the home context was deleted, since it doesn't gain us that much
  but can cause very strange bugs, since sub-propositions that might
  have been conceived while in an inference cache might unexpectedly be
  deleted by this function when the proposition gets printed somewhere,
  etc.  Instead, implement proper cleanup functions that utilize the new
  *structured-objects-index* which allows us to find all propositions
  asserted or inferred.  Since we now allocate all propositions at the
  module level, the significance of this change might have gone away.

clear-logic-module-hook:
  Changed to cleanup new structured objects index.

In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv7856

Modified Files:
	query.ste 
Log Message:
QUERY-ITERATOR.initial-bindings:
  New slot to better support reuse/reset of cached query iterators.
  This is primarily used to pass new initial bindings to the `reset'
  method, so we don't have to duplicate some of the reset logic in
  `make-cached-query'.

change-pattern-variable-binding:
  New - somewhat esotheric - function.

argument-bound-to:
  Streamlined with help of new `find-duplicate-description'.

help-bind-variable-to-value?:
unless (eql? boundToValue (value-of boundToValue))
  In some cases the elaboration might discover additional
  equivalences, and in those cases we change the binding of the
  variable here to point to the the newly discovered equivalent
  representative.
  We could do that when the bindings are collected at the top-level
  but that would prevent us from ever retrieving all members of an
  equivalence class (not implemented yet).

all-arguments-bound?, all-key-arguments-bound?:
  Improved with help of new `quantified-argument-bound?' which takes
  quantified variables into account and doesn't erroneously report those
  as unbound.

initialize-query-iterator:
  Record initial bindings if we had some.

try-to-defeat-last-answer?:
  Initialize initial bindings slot for the negated query so `reset'
  will automatically do the right thing.

QUERY-ITERATOR.reset:
  Improved: now also resets to previously stored `initial-bindings'.

make-cached-query:
  Performance fix: we don't have to re-optimize if we use dynamic
  optimization;  also fixed test to determine whether binding pattern
  changed - previous test was faulty and always succeeded which caused
  the bad performance in the first place.
  Streamlined.
  Folded variable rebinding logic into `reset', since we have to do
  the frame overlay with the pattern AFTER the new bindings are
  assigned, which means we can't call `reset' after the variables get
  bound and need `reset' to do it all.  Before, we didn't run into
  this problem, since the incorrect logic never reused a cached iterator.

Modified Files:

Log Message:
equate-and-simplify-forall-proposition:
  Removed, since this is now handled by
  `normalize-top-leve-proposition'.

derive-satellite-rules:
  Removed call to `equate-and-simplify-forall-proposition', since we
  have to do this during normalization to not fool the new duplicate
  detection scheme.

remove-exists-variable:
  Removed, since obsolete.

create-forward-chaining-index:
  Fixed and stream-lined: removal of non-consequent io-variables
  caused probles with destructive modification of the list we
  were iterating over which in some cases generated incorrect lists.

print-rules:
  Now pretty-prints rules and only reports true rules.  If we want all
  rules we might want to add a `:true-only?' option at some point.

Modified Files:

Log Message:
/PL-KERNEL-KB/HOLDS-specialist:
  Generalized to provide an `all-facts-of'-style result in case the
  relation variable is unbound.

non-recursive-single-valued-term?, single-valued-goal?,
help-single-valued-goal?, help-collect-singly-bound-variables:
  Improved, to - in effect - allow `single-valued-goal?' to be called
  recursively (needed by the query engine) and non-recursively (needed
  by `non-recursive-single-valued-term?').
  This solves an infinite recursion problem with rules such as
    (=> (R ?X ?Y) (EXISTS (?Z) (R ?X ?Z)))
  which caused `(single-valued-term? R)' to go into infinite
  recursion.

/PL-KERNEL-KB/name-to-object-computation:
  New object creation specialist.

/PL-KERNEL-KB/DIFFERENT-specialist:
  Improved to not punt on skolem arguments but instead check whether
  their values are all different.

Log Message:
In golf-handicap test-case, reenabled `propagate-constraints', since
we need that to get the required equality inference.  Also handled an
additional case with different assertion order.  Before, we
surrepetitiously got one answer due to overzelous evaluation of
function output arguments when the proposition was built (the new
duplicate detection scheme where we hold off on that brought that bug
back to light).

Various new test cases from recent bugs and additions of new features.

Update of /nfs/topaz/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/logic
In directory redhouse:/tmp/powerloom-3.2.4/sources/logic

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
clip-or-clash-with-old-predicate-value:
  Changed behavior to not unconditionally signal a clash but try to
  equate values first.  This used to create clashes when we inferred a
  skolem for a single-valued predicate that already had a value.  Due
  to the new mechanism for avoiding assertion of implied skolem
  propositiosn, this case doesn't come up anymore; however, the reverse
  where we asserted an existential and later on inferred a definite
  value can still occur.  Now these values are equated similar to what
  we do if we have function propositions.  The only minor issue is
  that we now have two propositions that represent a single output
  value.  The query engine knows how to handle that, but conceivably
  we should try to combine the two propositions and assert an equality
  similar to what we do for functions.

create-function-proposition:
  Now also calls duplicate detection machinery to make sure the
  proposition has been added to the index; otherwise,
  `inherit-function-proposition' in combination with top-level
  assertions might generate duplicate function propositions.

Log Message:
inherit-FUNCTION-proposition:
  Now takes `createSkolem?' argument which is passed through to
  `mapped-value-of'.  This allows the creation of skolems for one of its
  input arguments.  For the output argument we were already ok by some
  of the other inheritance machinery.

inherit-proposition, map-functional-value?:
  Pass new arg to `inherit-FUNCTION-proposition'.

create-skolem-for-unmapped-variable:
  Now collects created skolems in the mapping for 
  the benefit of `filter-implied-skolem-propositions'.

inherit-as-top-level-proposition:
  Fix order of returned inherited proposition.  This used to be relied
  upon by an earlier version of `filter-implied-skolem-propositions' but
  now actually isn't anymore; we'll leave it anyway.

filter-implied-skolem-propositions:
  New function.

inherit-description-propositions:
  Second return value for the benefit of `filter-implied-skolem-propositions'.

VECTOR.inherit-unnamed-description:
  Core change of this set: if a set of inherited propositions created
  some skolems due to existential variables, check whether the skolems
  are already implied by existing propositions, and, if so, don't assert
  the inherited propositions to minimize forward skolemization (also
  kills some cases of recursion).

	goal-caches.ste 
Log Message:
cache-goal:
  Fixed: avoid incorrect caching of description arguments that have
  external variables, since the bindings machinery doesn't currently
  record and test these bindings; this was exposed by the cardinality
  example I sent to Srini Ramaswamy on 6/9/08.
  In a sense, descriptions with open variables behave similar to
  unbound variables, they are bound if all the external variables are
  bound, or they could act as generators to generate matching
  descriptions.  The optimizer and also proposition lookup machinery
  should become more general to take this complexity into account.

Log Message:
CHECK-TYPES-RECORD, *check-types-agenda*, post-to-check-types-agenda,
process-check-types-agenda:
  Fixed performance problem for cases where we generated large numbers
  of violations.  This can happen if a large data file is loaded that
  has lots of assertions of the following form:
    (and (person fred) (mother-of fred susi))
  If `mother-of' has `person' as its argument types, it will fail type
  checks during build time, since the type proposition hasn't been
  asserted yet (it is built simultaneously but not yet asserted).
  Since the old `*check-types-agenda*' used a KEY-VALUE-LIST, this
  could lead to unpleasant quadratic insertion behavior.
  We now use a simple sequence to save space (instead of using a
  KEY-VALUE-MAP which would have solved the insertion performance issue)
  under the assumption that duplicate insertions for the same
  proposition will be rare.

Modified Files:
	normalize.ste 
Log Message:
normalize-top-level-proposition:
  Extracted the normalization code into
  `normalize-descriptive-proposition' which is now more precise with
  respect to the contexts in which normalization is performed.
  Eliminated the `ioVariables' argument, since we are not doing double
  duty anymore and are only normalizing forall propositions here.

normalize-descriptive-proposition:
  Extracted and improved from
  `normalize-top-level-descriptive-proposition'.
  Now is more precise to not do equating of io-variables in rule
  consequents, since that leads to rules that don't allow us to equate
  values in the consequent of a forward rule (e.g., the outputs of two
  functions in the antecedents).  This also caused some rules to break
  during parsing (see test suite).  The new `kind' keyword allows the
  caller to signal what kind of context it is in, since some
  descriptions are built specifically to serve as the head or the tail
  of a satellite rule or a forward chaining index.

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
evaluate-typed-argument:
  Use new function `evaluate-proposition-term' to better handle
  evaluation of arguments that are themselves propositions.

evaluate-proposition-term:
  New function.  In particular, needs to intuit whether a nested cons
  term is a function term yielding a proposition such as
  `(info-content statement-1)' or a function value proposition such as
  `(age fred 40)'.

evaluate-predicate-and-first-argument:
  New function extracted from `build-predicate-proposition' to deal
  with the various complexities involved (still has some holes).
  We don't do special testing for 0-arity anymore, since that is
  handled by the argument type check logic later.

build-predicate-proposition:
  Use new `evaluate-predicate-and-first-argument'.
  Fixed the case where the first argument to a function was a
  proposition which was not properly parsed due to destructive
  modification issues (see code).
  Added proper typed evaluation of the last argument of a function to
  make sure it gets coerced to a proposition if necessary.

finish-creating-function-proposition:
  Added proper fastening of arguments in case they are propositions
  themselves.

Log Message:
equate-top-level-equivalences:
  Further refined the handling of equivalences depending on context.
  Added a `kind' keyword (similar to what we did for other related
  functions), to signal the rule or description context the
  proposition is in.
  Now we allow the equating of io-variables with internal variables in
  the head of a rule, but we further refined which variable will point
  to what in order to make later collapsing and simplification do the
  right thing (i.e., now the argument order in calls to
  `equate-values' matters).

  Also eliminated the conditionalization for the collapsing of
  value-of chains, since (1) the test was incorrect and would always
  fail, and (2) it doesn't seem to be necessary anymore, so we do it
  unconditionally.

Log Message:
help-closed-term?:
  Fixed/improved: now also handles the explicit assertion of closure
  for arbitrary descriptions.  Additionally, we changed the clause for
  PATTERN-VARIABLE, since it was too permissive and the main reason
  why closure of MEMBER-OF goals with respect to their collection
  argument worked.  Instead, we made `help-closed-proposition?'
  smarter.

help-closed-proposition?:
  Fixed the computation of closure for MEMBER-OF propositions based on
  the type of the second argument.  Now, if we have a variable we
  additionally check whether it is the output of a SETOF or LISTOF term
  and only assume closure in those cases.
  See new test cases in test suite that illustrate some of these
  issues.

Update of /home/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/logic
In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv12088

Modified Files:
	propagate.ste 
Log Message:
Major rewrite of the forward chainer for better performance and inference
completeness.
- Now each context has a propagation environment attached to it that keeps
  track of elaborated objects, etc.  This replaces the special-purpose
  per-object slots that pointed to worlds an object was elaborated in, its
  evaluation state, etc.  Maintaining all this information and complexity more
  centrally makes (1) things a bit more modular and easier to deal with if,
  for example, a cache world gets deleted, and (2) allows us to make JIT
  forward inference more efficient, since now we can keep track which
  propositions have been posted previously and don't need to be reposted when
  a new object is being elaborated.
- The new `post-related-facts' is used to find facts relevant to an object's
  elaboration.  It is now much more efficient than the previous version by
  using a hash table instead of a list, by not reposting facts that have were
  posted during a prior elaboration, and is more complete with respect to
  following equivalences and function terms which solves various inference
  problems with nested function terms.
- We now can handle depth-limited forward skolemization which was necessary to
  deal with some of the rules from the LBR project.
- evaluation of function propositions is now handled more stream-lined and
  generically using the new computation and constraint functions.
- backward antecedents of complex forward rules are now only back-chained in
  shallow mode to avoid expensive backward inference during forward inference.
  This can be overcome by wrapping a `query' around if necessary.

PROPAGATION-ENVIRONMENT, CONTEXT.propagation-environment,
get-propagation-environment, PROPAGATION-ENVIRONMENT.{defer-default-proposition, 
clear-propagation-queues, copy:
  New definitions.

CONTEXT.deferred-default-propositions-internal, deferred-default-propositions,
deferred-default-propositions-setter:
  Removed.

CONTEXT.{evaluation-queue, evaluation-state-table}:
  Removed.

evaluation-state, evaluation-state-setter:
  Changed for new PROPAGATION-ENVIRONMENT scheme.

post-for-evaluation:
  Changed for new PROPAGATION-ENVIRONMENT scheme.
  Now takes a context argument to which the propagation environment is or will
  be attached.

CONTEXT.forward-chaining-queue, *currentlyExecutingForwardChainingQueue*:
  Removed.

post-to-forward-chaining-queue:
  Changed for new PROPAGATION-ENVIRONMENT scheme.
  Eliminated limited forward skolemization code, since that is now handled
  more generally in `apply-rule-consequent-to-vector'.

SKOLEM.skolem-generation-count, *max-skolem-generation-count*:
  New definitions.

apply-rule-consequent-to-vector:
  Now handles limited forward skolemization more generically.
  Now queries backwards antecedents of complex rules only in shallow mode.
  Also fixes a bug by disabling recursive forward inference/elaboration during
  back chaining, since it could destructively modify the cached query run here
  in a recursive call - this is seriously not thread safe.

PROPOSITION.react-to-inference-update:
  Eliminated obsolete and incorrect truth-value check logic (this aspect
  should now be handled by `assign-truth-value').

PROPAGATION-ENVIRONMENT.execute-propagation-queues:
  Extracted from old version of `execute-constraint-propagation-queues'.

execute-constraint-propagation-queues:
  Rewritten with help of the above.

evaluate-FUNCTION-proposition:
  Streamlined with help of new `compute-simple-relation-constraint' and friends.
  Now also handles the case where all arguments are bound when a potential
  clash might occur.

LOGIC-OBJECT.elaborated-in-worlds:
  Removed.

elaborate-instance:
  Changed for new PROPAGATION-ENVIRONMENT scheme.
  Moved saftey checks into `get-propagation-environment'.
  Improved performance and completeness via new `post-related-facts'.

evaluate-reachable-inequalities:
  Changed for new PROPAGATION-ENVIRONMENT scheme.
  The test for the appropriate evaluation state is now done by
  `post-for-evaluation'.

collect-function-proposition-facts:
  Removed.

follow-dependent-proposition-argument?, post-related-facts:
  New definitions that compute an `all-facts-of'-style elaboration
  environment, however, this is much more efficient by not reposting things that
  were posted in previous elaborations, by using a hash table instead of a list,
  and by including a larger space of dependent propositions linked via skolems
  and equivalence propositions, which is crucial for the evaluation of some
  nested function terms (see for example the new `timepoints.ste' demo).
  `post-related-facts' also fixes a bug with truth-value determination for
  function propositions, which cannot rely on variable-value links, since we are
  currently in the process of generating them.

help-collect-facts:
  Improved: use hash-set instead of a list for duplicate detection, since the
  simple list would run us into performance problems for cases where we have
  lots of dependent propositions (surfaced with Argos KBs).  Also streamlined
  to be more similar to the new `post-related-facts' above.  However, this is
  less inclusive than `post-related-facts' and now does not include facts about
  function terms such as (boss fred) anymore, since they are not directly
  about fred.

all-facts-of-instance:
  Rewritten for improved `help-collect-facts'.

compute-simple-relation-constraint:

  this).  This was handled explicitly in the old version of
  `evaluate-function-proposition', but now that we merged everything
  into a single function, that part had disappeared.

find-duplicate-complex-proposition:
  Fixed to not fail in case the existing stored proposition has some

  is a kludge to deal with the currently messed up situation when we
  have mixed or global rewrapping.  If we fix the literal eql? methods
  to work for subtypes on the second argument as well, this kludge could
  likely go away.

Modified Files:
	backlinks.ste 
Log Message:
Added some comments for future work to fix up the backlinking of

index-ith-domain?:
  Disabled for now, since mixed rewrapping can lead to strange
  failures, due to the fact that logic-wrappers and standard wrappers
  are only eql? in one direction (since object-eql? methods in STELLA
  treat the literal types as final).
  Also, this function is highly bizarre and unfinished and needs to be
  rewritten anyway if we ever resurrect this in some form or other.

rewrap-ith-argument?:
  Added check for already rewrapped arguments that has backlinks to
  avoid re-rewrapping.

  Fixed: the new improved `find-duplicate-complex-propsition' now

  Hence, we now call `find-or-create-...' here instead of just
  `create-'.

compute-relation-value:

  Fixed/kludged funcall of variable-arguments computations in Java.
  Once we adapt to the new variable argument handling supported in
  Java 1.5 and beyond, this can go away.

IST-specialist, SAVED-CONTEXT-PROOF-ADJUNCT:
  Fixed to properly re-enter the context specified as the argument of
  the IST proposition when multiple solutions are retrieved.  Before,
  when the second solution was sought, we immediately entered the down
  frame of the IST frame which bypassed any logic to properly re-enter
  the context.  Now we save the down frame on the adjunct and force
  execution of the IST frame for each down move which can properly set
  the context first before additional solutions are retrieved.

Log Message:
help-bind-variable-to-value?:
  Disabled a previous change from 2006/05/08: changing the variable value
  to an equivalent is a bad idea, since the equivalence might be due to a
  hypothetical context (e.g., in PL-Mediator), which, once the context
  goes away, leaves us with an incorrect binding.  We now dereference
  bindings at the top level, since collecting all members of an
  equivalence class will need a specialist and a LISTOF result term
  anyway (since too often they are evaluated during inference so there
  is no way to ensure that we'll collect all intensionally different
  objects).  Therefore, enabling such collection in a retrieve also
  goes away as the motivation for updating variable bindings.

QUERY-ITERATOR.next?:
  Now we dereference/evaluate bindings here in case any new
  equivalences were discovered during elaboration triggered by the
  query.

make-query:
  Fixed: now it binds `*queryIterator*' to block any variable bindings
  in nested calls to not break when we build the query description.

Modified Files:
	SoapSender.java 
Log Message:
Added import for common.Utils class so we can call `debugPrintln'.

serverURL, defaultWebServicePath:
  New variables, adjusted to new PowerLoom HTTP server URL structure.

setServerURL:
  New API function that allows us to set a URL different from the
  default version.  This is useful when we call the gui from an
  embedded environment (e.g., via `start-powerloom-gui').
  Also caches the set or constructed URL, so it doesn't have to
  be regenerated during every SOAP message call.

getServerURL:
  Now simply an accessor for the result of `setServerURL'.

Replaced various calls to `System.out.println' with `debugPrintln' so
we can better control/suppress the generation of debugging output.

Modified Files:
	PowerloomApp.java 
Log Message:
Added import for common.Utils class so we can call `debugPrintln'.
Added import for gui.serverinterface for easier access to Soap utilities.

getServerInfo:
  New `error' parameter to optionally suppress an exception if the
  server is not reachable.  This allows us to better handle situations
  where the server defined in the properties file isn't available.

doStartup:
  Try to connect to the server but fail quietly in case there was an
  error, since in order to generate the error pane the main app window
  has to be initialized and visible.  A connection error is now
  handled in the `main' method.

main:
  Now supports various command-line parameters, mainly to better
  support settings of the server port and service URL for embedded
  application (e.g., when started via `start-powerloom-gui').
  Now also handles setting of `debugLevel' for more controlled
  generation of debugging output.
  Added a sleep interval so we can see the splash screen a bit longer.
  Now handles the "can't connect to server" error that was previously
  (incorrectly) handled in `doStartup'.

Replaced various calls to `System.out.println' with `debugPrintln' and
friends so we can better control/suppress the generation of debugging output.

changeMetalTheme:
  New function to change the UI theme.  This now properly propagates
  the change to all subcomponents via `updateComponentTreeUI.
  Also improved exception handling.

metalThemeMenuItem_ActionPerformed, demoThemeMenuItem_ActionPerformed,
bigThemeMenuItem_ActionPerformed:
  Re/implemented via new `changeMetalTheme' and new
  `ZoomedMetalTheme'.

  Calling `updateComponentTreeUI' during theme change caused a problem
  with `setParent' when called on a `ComponentInputMap' (even before we
  called `setParent'); it was unhappy that the parent map wasn't of the
  proper type and/or wasn't linked to the correct component.  After many
  tries I still couldn't find an incantation that set this up
  correctly; however, simply using a plain `InputMap' finally fixed the
  problem.

Update of /nfs/topaz/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/powerloom-server
In directory redhouse:/home/hans/Projects/powerloom/sources/powerloom-server

Modified Files:
	server-interface.ste 
Log Message:
Updated copyright.

server-log-level<=:
  Renamed from `log-level<=' to not conflict with the standard STELLA
  function.

pl-object-to-gui-name, gui-name-to-pl-name:
  New name-translation function to better deal with quoting etc. when
  shipping names between the gui and the server.

SERVER-GET-SOURCE-FOR-CONCEPT, SERVER-GET-SUPERCONCEPTS-FOR-CONCEPT,
SERVER-GET-SUPERRELATIONS-FOR-RELATION,
SERVER-GET-SUPERRELATIONS-FOR-RELATION,
SERVER-GET-VARIABLES-FOR-RELATION, SERVER-GET-TYPES-FOR-INSTANCE,
SERVER-GET-EXTENSION-FOR-RELATION, SERVER-GET-RELATION,
SERVER-GET-CONCEPT, SERVER-GET-INSTANCE, CREATE-CONCEPT-CONTAINER,
CREATE-RELATION-CONTAINER, MAKE-PL-RELATION, MAKE-PL-CONCEPT,
MAKE-SURROGATE-SURROGATE, MAKE-LOGIC-SURROGATE, MAKE-PL-INSTANCE,
GET-DOCUMENTATION-FOR-OBJECT, GET-PROPOSITIONS-FOR-OBJECT,
GET-RULES-FOR-RELATION, GET-RELEVANT-RULES-FOR-RELATION,
GET-PROPOSITIONS-FOR-INSTANCE-AND-RELATION:
  Use new name translation functions.

MAKE-PL-OBJECT-UNION:
  Fixed to not break on special objects such as timepoints.

CREATE-SUPERRELATIONS-CONTAINER, CREATE-VARIABLES-LIST,
MAKE-PL-RELATION, MAKE-PL-CONCEPT:
  Fixed: generalized type for non_proper relations, since we might get
  instances that have `relation' asserted about them.

GET-PROPOSITION-STRING:
  Fixed to not print ugly variable bindings in quantified variables
  that make the GUI break.

XMLIFY-FORMATTED-STRING:
  Re-instated quoting via `REPLACE-CHOKABLE-CHARS-WITH-ENTITIES, since
  `write-html-quoting-special-characters' doesn't quote newlines,
  hence, they get lost in translation.
  This now re-instates \n characters in saved formatted queries,
  however, we still lose those upon insertion into the query panel -
  need to figure out what's going on there.

  support.

/ploom/soap-rpc/gui-service:
  Handler definition under new URL that better fits the overall
  architecture (also changed in the GUI code as well as in a print
  statement in `start-powerloom-server' defined in logic/logic-in.ste).

Update of /nfs/topaz/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/powerloom-server
In directory redhouse:/home/hans/Projects/powerloom/sources/powerloom-server

Modified Files:
	server-interface.ste 
Log Message:
server-log:
  Adapted to use standard STELLA logging support (which we extended to
  take a log-file argument).

*query-session-timeout*, get-query-session:
  New definitions to implement improved query session support.

SERVER-QUERY:
  Use new query session functions and pass session object to
  `EVALUATE-QUERY-COMMAND-IN-MODULE' (which also needs to be cleaned up).

SERVER-GET-EXPLANATION-FOR-QUERY:
  Use new query session functions.
  Don't XMLIFY the explanation string anymore, since we are generating
  HTML which doesn't need any extra quoting beyond what we standardly do.

EVALUATE-QUERY-COMMAND-IN-MODULE:
  Added new session argument, since the access of the session object
  needs access to the PLQuery XML object.
  Use new query session functions.
  This function needs to be rewritten and cleaned up.

XMLIFY-FORMATTED-STRING:
  Backpatched to not do any quoting, since that would create problems
  with explanation strings and printing of propositions.
  The whole quoting philosophy needs to be rethought and cleaned up,
  currently it's a big mess, since there are too many players that do
  quoting and unquoting at various stages (STELLA, the server, Castor,
  CDATA,....).  FIX THIS.

TEST-SERVER-QUERY:
  Adapted, since we eliminated `*REQUESTOR-ADDRESS*'.

Modified Files:
	arithmetic.ste 
Log Message:
string-concatenate-computation:
  Generalized: we replaced the constraint with a computation that takes a variable
  number of arguments and coerces them to a string first if necessary.
  KLUDGE: since we can't use `apply' on functions with variable arguments in C++
  (yet, since we need the extra n-args argument which we can't pass in in the
  list of arguments), we require that vararg computations expect the variable
  number of args as a CONS-list instead of a &rest argument (see also
  `compute-relation-value').

string-match-computation-helper:
  FIXED: now actually handles -n for counting from end and also
  supports that for start and also added some extra sanity checks.

Log Message:
ENTITY-MAPPING:

find-duplicate-named-description:
  FIXED: check whether the defined arity of the named description matches the one
  of `self' which might not be the case for variable-arity descriptions.  In that
  case we want to keep `self', otherwise QUERY might not work
  correctly.

equate-top-level-equivalences:
  Ensure both arguments are variables or fully ground constants
  (i.e., exclude propositions and descriptions with external vars,
  since those need to be instantiated during inference).

Log Message:
*levellized-backchaining-enabled?*:
  BUG: the problem with levellized normal (backchaining) inference
  these is that these functions don't do proper recursive subgoal
  handling (since that machinery only works within a single query and
  not across recursive query invocations on the function stack).
  This switch allows us to turn that off until we know how to do that
  correctly.

NORMAL-INFERENCE-LEVEL.{levellized-test-type-on-instance?,
levellized-all-class-instances, levellized-all-relation-values,
levellized-test-relation-on-arguments?,
levellized-get-slot-minimum-cardinality,
levellized-get-slot-maximum-cardinality,

  for now until we know how to handle recursion properly.

has-forward-justifications?, get-forward-justifications,

Log Message:
coerce-option-value:
  Moved into stella/systems.ste (now `coerce-value-to-type').

parse-logic-command-options:
  Now implemented via new `parse-options' which we moved into STELLA.
  We still leave `parse-logic-command-options' around, since we might do
  additional things here in the future.

*file-load-path*, parse-directory-path, set-load-path, get-load-path,
push-load-path, pop-load-path, add-load-path, drop-load-path,
find-file-in-load-path:
  All moved into STELLA (systems.ste) to make it available to wider

demo-entry-file:
  Now supply `*powerloom-kb-file-extensions*', since now
  `find-file-in-load-path' is using different defaults.

demo:
  Changed to evaluate arguments so we can parameterize it with
  properties.

help-define-keyword-axioms:
  Special-case SETOFALL and KAPPA terms to not interpret them as
  arguments to a multi-valued relation.

call-defobject, normalize-defobject-arguments:
  Generalized: also allow definition of function terms.

process-definition-options:
  Don't reset options anymore, since it wipes out annotations that
  directly came from the proposition (such as =>>, etc.).  The drawback
  is that if we previously had an annotation that we now want to get
  rid of, it has to be explicitly set to false in the redefinition.

Log Message:
variable-bound?:
  Improved: don't break if we are called outside of a query such as
  when we are building descriptions and are equating equivalences.

computed-predicate?:
  Generalized to also handle HOLDS with bound relation argument.

dynamically-estimate-inference-cost:
  New function.

dynamically-estimate-goal-cost:
  Use new `dynamically-estimate-inference-cost' instead of a fixed
  penalty.

count-bound-arguments:
  New function.

dynamically-estimate-unbound-variable-penalty:
  Handle fence post case with HOLDS applied to a function.

dynamically-reoptimize-arguments:
  Improved cost estimation for unbound arguments.

inherit-FUNCTION-proposition:
  Fixed: ensure we properly inherit structured arguments in case we
  had propositional arguments (e.g. HOLDS).

old-find-similar-proposition:
  New name for old version of `find-similar-proposition' which used a
  search along argument backlinks as its driver.  This could be a big
  performance bottleneck in some cases if arguments had large numbers of
  backlinks.

new-find-similar-proposition:
  New version that uses the `proposition-hash-index' for propositions
  which was extended to also account for argument mappings.

find-similar-proposition:
  Now implemented via `new-find-similar-proposition'.  Testing
  revealed that the new implementation is equivalent to the old one (but
  more stable with respect to execution time).

proposition-references-terms?, create-skolem-propositions-query,
filter-implied-skolem-propositions:
  Generalized handling of implied skolem propositions.

map-and-enqueue-variable?:
  Eliminated the pushing of `variable' onto a queue, since we don't
  need to do that anymore due to the now precomputed evaluation order of
  structural functions. 

compute-structural-function-evaluation-order,
DESCRIPTION.structural-function-evaluation-order,
get-structural-function-evaluation-order:
  New support for computing and caching the evaluation order of structural functions.

map-functional-value?:
  Also eliminated the `queue' argument.

inherit-description-propositions:
  Greatly simplified due to new `get-structural-function-evaluation-order'.

SKOLEM-FUNCTION, skolem-fn:
  New definitions needed by experimental code in rules.ste to properly

proposition-arity:
  New accessors to deconstruct propositions.

ASSERTION-QUERY, SHALLOW-QUERY, SUBSUMPTION-QUERY, BACKTRACKING-QUERY,
NORMAL-QUERY, REFUTATION-QUERY:
  New query relations for specific inference levels.  These are more
  efficient than calling QUERY for this, since they don't involve the
  construction of a full-fledged query iterator.

type-of:
  Removed rule which is redundant due to the :inverse annotation.

closed:
  Use nicer definition syntax.

collect-into-list, collect-into-ordered-set:
  New collection relations.

nth-element, first-element, second-element, third-element,
fourth-element, fifth-element, nth-head, nth-rest, insert-element,
list-concatenate:
  New support for list access and de/construction.

string-concatenate:
  Generalized to use variable number of args and automatic coercion to
  strings.  This is very useful for creating names on the fly.

different:
  Fixed annotations to properly support `(not (different ...))' which
  we have to use in cases where we want to avoid the simplification
  and normalization on `=' terms.

commutative:
  Rewrote rule, since `binary-relation' can't be evaluated in shallow
  mode (since it involves a rule).

evaluation-state, evaluation-state-setter:
  Make these no-ops in description mode (as it was in the old scheme).

evaluate-new-proposition:
  Fixed: this was called on descriptive propositions in regular extensional assertion
  mode, which caused problems with the P-Track `any-value' function computation.

evaluate-EQUIVALENT-proposition:
  Enabled disjointness testing - this is still somewhat experimental.

Update of /home/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/logic
In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv1372

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
ENTITY-MAPPING:
  Moved here, since now referenced by `proposition-hash-index'.
  Also changed into a `KEY-VALUE-MAP' now to avoid performance issues
  with large mappings.

assign-truth-value:
  Experiment: if we derive a mismatching truth value for a constant
  proposition signal a clash anyway - this helps with LBR clashes.

signal-truth-value-clash:
  Avoid modifying global proposition constants.

TRUE-PROPOSITION, FALSE-PROPOSITION:
  Fixed (help with LBR clashes): put them in the proper module and add them to the
  duplicate index, so a false proposition derived from a rule consequent such as
  '(not (= ?x/a ?y/a))' will find the corresponding constant prop and then generate
  a clash.  however, the maybe better fix would be to not derive a constant prop
  in the first place, so we can record the result as inconsistent (since we can't
  modify the constants).

update-isa-proposition, update-property:
  Fixed: even though we know that there isn't a duplicate, we do want
  to check during fastening, since it will insert it into the structured
  objects index; otherwise, duplicates created by regular assertions
  won't be found.

proposition-hash-index:
  Generalized to work with a supplied mapping, so we can use it during
  inherit-proposition.

process-check-types-agenda:
  Make sure we are in extensional assertion mode.  Fixes a problem
  when disjoint-terms? is called during evaluation of a descriptive
  proposition and suddenly isa props were evaluated in description
  mode. The question is whether a more general place such as
  call-[cached]-ask, call-[cached]-retrieve should be guarded
  similarly.

finish-creating-function-proposition:
  fixed: ensure we normalize function propositions in case they have
  propositional or holds arguments we call `normalize-function-proposition' 
  directly, since otherwise flattening might happening which can screw
  things up at this stage.

create-enumerated-set:
  Sort arguments and check for duplicates so we can easily find
  previously created terms that are equivalent.

create-logical-list:
  Improved: look for duplicates.

destroy-logic-context-hook:
  Unlink any propagation environments and clear dynamic slots.

proposition-less-than?:
  Check special case where we are looking at two identical function
  propositions that aren't EQ (even though they probably should be);
  this avoids infinite recursion which isn't handled in all cases in
  `logic-form-less?' (see also comments there); since we fixed duplicate
  SETOF/LISTOF term generation, this check isn't strictly needed anymore.

logic-form-less?:
  Made more robust to avoid breakage via an incompatible quantity
  exception.

In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv1413

Modified Files:
	query.ste 
Log Message:
QUERY-ITERATOR.depth-cutoffs?:
  New slot to record depth cutoffs.

safe-argument-bound-to:
  Generalized.

bind-variable-to-value?, bind-argument-to-value?:
  Better handle descriptions and propositions with unbound external
  arguments.

unwind-to-choice-points-below-frame:
  Experimental fix: only unwind at the farthest down frame, since some of the bindings
  (e.g., in a nested AND/OR expression, might still be valid and be needed).

evaluate-next-move:
  Fixed: moved creation of choicepoint into `initiate-atomic-goal-proofs' after
  yield-goal-bindings is called, otherwise, bindings cached during that step (e.g.,
  from description variables being bound to computed values) will immediately
  be undone in `continue-strategies-proofs'.  However, this now can
  also cause problems, since now `safe-argument-bound-to' picks up these
  bindings which makes `compute-simple-relation-constraint' think the
  variable was bound, and we wind up with an unbound variable problem
  on our way back.

continue-or-proof:
  FIXED: Only create a choice point if we are moving down to a new goal,
  otherwise the creation might undo variable bindings we still need.

initiate-atomic-goal-proofs:
  Moved choice point creation here from `evaluate-next-move' (see above).
  Enable retrieval of cached results again, since we need that for
  recursive rules.

compute-external-bindings, instantiate-external-bindings:
  Robustified.

*trace-disjointness-subgoals?*:
  New switch.

disjoint-terms?:
  Fixed boostrap issue.
  Added new tracing support.
  Memoize it - needs improvement.
  Set evaluation mode properly, since it this might be called during
  the evaluation of descriptive propositions; should we always set it
  for ASK & RETRIEVE?

handle-depth-violation:
  Register a cutoff occurrence on the query iterator.

print-query-iterator-ornately:
  Annotate depth cutoffs.

parse-query-and-options:
  Now wrap free vars that are not output vars in an existential.

process-query-options:
  Handle new :CHECK-VARIABLES? option.

coerce-to-string:
  Moved into STELLA.

*inline-query-cache*, clear-inline-query-caches, find-cached-query,
*max-cached-queries-per-id*, free-cached-query, make-cached-query,
apply-cached-retrieve, apply-cached-ask:
  GENERALIZED: we needed a more sophisticated allocation scheme, since we might
  have recursive calls of the same cached query with different args while
  the ones from earlier calls are still active.

update-propositions-from-query:
  Handle recording of justifications.
  FIXED: always call `update-proposition-truth-value', since
  `update-equivalence-proposition' is a no-op if both arguments are
  skolems (it wants to unify them during fwd-chaining).

assert-from-query:
  Handle recording of justifications.
  Change handling of :relation option, since now value coercion does
  not handle descriptions anymore (since we moved that into STELLA).

retract-from-query:
  Change handling of :relation option, since now value coercion does
  not handle descriptions anymore (since we moved that into STELLA).

Modified Files:
	specialists.ste 
Log Message:
computation-input-bound?:
  New helper for `compute-relation-value'.

compute-relation-value:
  Use `computation-input-bound?'.
  New scheme of passing variable arguments as a cons list, since
  `apply' can't yet handle varargs in C++ (and Java).

HOLDS-specialist:
  Fixed: use proper truth-value test to handle function propositions.

PROPOSITION-RELATION-computation, PROPOSITION-ARGUMENT-computation,
PROPOSITION-ARGUMENTS-computation, PROPOSITION-ARITY-computation:
  New support for proposition accessors.

FORK-PROOF-ADJUNCT, FORK-specialist:
  New support for properly recording justifications of the test
  condition as well as the if or then clause.

create-query-specialist-iterator:
  Check for a duplicate of the subquery description.

SAVED-INFERENCE-LEVEL-PROOF-ADJUNCT,
leveled-query-relation-to-inference-level, LEVELED-QUERY-specialist:
  New support for leveled query relations.

COLLECT-MEMBERS-specialist:
  Renamed from `COLLECT-INTO-SET-specialist'.
  Now also supports COLLECT-INTO-LIST and COLLECT-INTO-ORDERED-SET.
  Now properly supports recording of justifications of all antecedents
  that led to a collected element.
  FIXED: use an equal? test to remove duplicates in case we have a non-unary relation
  that produces cons tuples (even though that probably doesn't make sense anyway)..

NTH-ELEMENT-specialist, NTH-HEAD-computation, NTH-REST-computation,
INSERT-ELEMENT-computation:
  New support for list manipulation relations.

name-to-object-computation:
  Fixed to properly handle names that contain funny characters such as `/'.

In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv2500

Modified Files:
	strategies.ste 
Log Message:
continue-specialist-proof:
  Don't trap specialist execution errors if we are developing in Lisp,
  since we usually want to fix those and the exact state where the
  error happens might be difficult to recover.

try-goal-caches-proof:
  Efficiency fix: don't try to scan cached goals unless the goal only
  has a single instantiation.  Otherwise, because of our incomplete
  caching scheme we wind up regenerating all the cached values anyway,
  which usually leads to a lot of duplicated effort.
  We really need to fix this properly at some point.

extract-collection-argument:
  Generalized return type.

In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv13947

Modified Files:
	strategies.ste 
Log Message:
resume-proof-strategy-after-subgoal:
  Added case for :DISJUNCTIVE-IMPLICATION-INTRODUCTION to avoid
  propagating up falsity of the to-be-proven disjunct.

resume-disjunctive-implication-proof:
  New resumption method, since we need to make sure we are not propagating a
  false truth value up to the OR in case we found that the to-be-proven
  disjunct is actually FALSE.  I.e., (OR A B) should be UNKNOWN (not
  FALSE) if A is UNKNOWN and B is FALSE.
  This fixes one test case in the test suite that previously returned
  FALSE by mistake.  It now makes one of the test cases go UNKNOWN
  instead of FALSE, even though FALSE would be the correct answer;
  However, the or-introduction machinery isn't enough anymore to uncover
  the inconsistency between the rule (=> (A ?x) (NOT (B ?x))) and
  (=> (A a) (B b)) which is normalized to (OR (NOT (A a)) (B b)).
  The only way to find the inconsistency is to assume the OR and
  (A a) and then see that that leads to a clash on (B b).  However,
  since we are trying to prove the OR as opposed to knowing it to be
  true, the clash never occurs.

Update of /home/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/logic
In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv381

Modified Files:
	query.ste 
Log Message:
Added a DEBUG-ID to QUERY-ITERATOR to make tracing during debugging easier.
Changed arguments to CREATE-QUERY-ITERATOR, INITIALIZE-QUERY-ITERATOR and
  MAKE-QUERY to support the debug id.
Updated truth value printing to use TRUTH-VALUE-TO-STRING
Updated CONTROL-FRAME printing to indicate reverse polarity 

TRACE-SOLUTION: Changed to use query-iterator argument rather than special variable.

CALL-ASK
TRY-TO-DEFEAT-LAST-ANSWER
QUERY-ITERATOR.NEXT?
   Updated to support :four-valued? keyword and processing.  This option will
   for inconsistent values by trying to disprove any result, not just default
   valued ones.  Also added support for clash justifications to the results.
   BUG: :four-valued? doesn't work properly with :inference-level :refutation
         or partial match mode.

Modified Files:
	arithmetic.ste 
Log Message:
INEQUALITY-evaluator:
  FIXED: since this IS the evaluator and there is no constraint or
  computation attached to inequalities, we have to handle the evaluation
  of bound arguments here and can't farm it out to
  `evaluate-predicate-proposition'.  This now raises appropriate
  contradictions when we assert (or infer) things like
  (> 8 9).  For an assertion to trigger this, we still need to
  do `run-forward-rules'.
