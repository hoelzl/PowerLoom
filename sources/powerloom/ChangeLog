Update of /nfs/image2/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/logic
In directory redhouse:/home/hans/Projects/powerloom/sources/logic

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
TRUTH-VALUE:
  Added `polarity' and `strength' slots so predicates like `true?'
  can be more informed when called with truth values that are
  different than the standard truth value constants (this is not used
  yet but might be once we attach justifications).

assign-truth-value:
  Handle new INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE.  Once a proposition is
  inconsistent, it cannot be assigned any other truth value until it has
  been explicitly retracted via `deassign-truth-value'.
  Fix handling of built-in proposition constants, so we can't
  accidentally assing a truth value to them (e.g., via (assert (or))).

deassign-truth-value:
  Handle new :RETRACT-INCONSISTENT update mode.

TRUE-TRUTH-VALUE TRUTH-VALUE, FALSE-TRUTH-VALUE,
DEFAULT-TRUE-TRUTH-VALUE, DEFAULT-FALSE-TRUTH-VALUE,
UNKNOWN-TRUTH-VALUE:
  Initialize new `polarity' and `strength' slots.
  Folded in initialization of `positive-score' (not sure anymore why
  this was done in separate startup code before).

INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE:
  New truth value to flag inconsistent propositions.

true?, false?:
  Fixed handling of non-standard truth-values.  Before that was
  strictly done based on `positive-score' which caused problems with the
  new INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE (and is simply wrong anyway).

unknown?:
  Now subsumes `inconsistent?'.

inconsistent?, inconsistent-truth-value?:
  New predicates.

conjoin-truth-values, invert-truth-value, print-truth-value:
  Handle new INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE.

signal-truth-value-clash:
  Now assigns the INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE to avoid any further
  propagation from it.

unbind-skolem-value:
  Fixed: break the skolem-value link before we look for the equating
  proposition, otherwise we might pick the wrong one from a function
  proposition that has the same value.  Fixes retraction problem of function
  propositions that share their value with others.

find-equating-proposition:
  Streamlined the search for a backlinked object, since the search
  loop would never execute anyway.  What the loop was trying to
  achieve was to find the innermost skolem that points to the non-logic
  object, but the way it was written that would never occur.
  Rethink this, not sure this is really needed.

check-type?:
  Robustfied by checking for a NULL object.

unassert:
  Fixed, generalized: now returns the list of affected propositions
  just like `retract' and does the right thing for function propositions.
  Now also lets one unassert inconsistent propositions.

unassert-proposition:
  Renamed from `unassert-fact'.
  Now properly handles function propositions and inconsistent
  propositions.

Modified Files:
	specialists.ste 
Log Message:
MEMBER-OF-evaluator:
  Fixed: make sure the evaluated proposition is actually true.
  Improved: now checks membership assertions to an enumerated set to
  make sure the assertion is not contradictory.  If it is, it signals a
  clash.  For example, the following proposition now causes a clash:

        (member-of pink (setof red green blue))

  This fixes a bug with missing clashes for assertions to concepts
  that were defined via explicit enumeration.

s-ask, s-retrieve:
  Improved documentation.
  Fixed: make sure we read the arguments in the proper module.
  Eliminated DWIM-ing of extra level of parentheses.  Now we expect
  all arguments to be at the top level, i.e., without a surrounding set
  of parentheses.  This is since we can't really reliably intuit
  whether to drop them or not without doing some more extensive
  parsing (especially true for `s-retrieve').  One way to look at this
  is that for the `s-...' versions the string quotes play the role of
  the surrounding parentheses.

  GET-NAME changed to always return a fully qualified name.
  GET-SHORT-NAME added to return only the name portion.
  GET-NAME-IN-MODULE added to provide new access to a name that will be
     what is needed to access the named object from the given module.

Changes to creation functions to make them return objects with names in
the proper namespaces.  This affects
  CREATE-OBJECT, CREATE-CONCEPT, CREATE-RELATION, CREATE-FUNCTION.

Modified Files:
	strategies.ste 
Log Message:
*pl-anonymous-module*:
  New variable.

create-anonymous-instance:
  New function.

create-hypothesized-instance:
  Replaces `create-hypothesized-skolem'.  The main difference (besides
  putting the name into a separate module) is that this creates an
  instance instead of a skolem.  This solves a problem in case we are
  instantiating a class that generates a rule for each of its
  instances.  Example:

        (defconcept dicot (?dicot angiosperm)
	    :<=> (AND (cardinality (fillers cotyledon-of ?dicot) 2)
		      (forall ?l (=> (AND (leaf ?l)
					  (leaf-of ?dicot ?l))
				     (netted-vein-leaf ?l)))
                      ....))

  The problem with that was that the rule was instantiated with a
  skolem (the anonymous instance) which in turn tripped us up during
  generation of satellite rules which called `generate' somewhere
  along the way to find a duplicate description.  This new mechanism
  doesn't really change the result, but it avoids the warning and any
  other problems we might experience with skolems.  Hypothetical
  instances aren't really skolems, they are not anonymous in the
  hypothetical context, only outside.

try-universal-introduction-proof:
  Use improved `create-hypothesized-instance' instead of
  `create-hypothesized-skolem' (which see).

  canonicalization this would now have to handled by
  `normalize-proposition' and it generates less garbage if it is done

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
Eliminated canonicalization of proposition CONS-trees, since it
duplicates functionality of `normalize-proposition', doesn't save
much/anything and caused some bugs.  In particular, it caused problems
with implication rules that were wrapped with ABOUT to indicate
direction.  For example, the following was translated incorrectly:

   (=>> (foo ?x ?y) (and (bar ?x) (bar ?y) (fum ?x ?y)))

When the rule was canonicalized into

   (=> (foo ?x ?y) (and (bar ?x) (bar ?y))
   (=> (foo ?x ?y) (fum ?x ?y))

the ABOUT annotation was not properly propagated.  Also, the
canonicalization wasn't done properly, otherwise we would have had
three rules.  Fixing this here was the wrong place; eliminating it
alltogether was the way to go - we hope.

remove-true-and-false, flatten-nested-operators,
canonicalize-and-or-tree, canonicalize-negation-tree,
all-variables-goal?, equal-arguments?, explode-forall-tree,
canonicalize-quantification-tree, CONS.canonicalize-proposition-tree:
  Removed.

quantifier-symbol?:
  Replaced by `kif-quantifier-symbol?' in kif-in.ste.

canonicalize-proposition-tree:
  Made into a dummy place-holder in case we want to resurrect some of
  this.

  going meta in the consequent the standard lookup/specialization

  implies-links if they are marked as forward-only.

Log Message:
destroy-all-inference-caches:

handle-out-of-date-inference-cache:
  Propagate destruction of a JIT cache to all submodules, since
  inferences were also inherited down and need to be retracted there.
  This caused various problems with `edb' information
  assertion/retraction in KOJAK.
  This also needs to be revisited when the whole cache mess gets

Log Message:
help-select-relation-propositions:
  Renamed from `select-relation-propositions' due to new memoization
  scheme.
  Improved key filtering loop to only do the more complex test if the
  correct position has to be verified.

select-relation-propositions:
  Now memoized for performance reasons.  This significantly speeds up
  data-intensive queries such as the EELD benchmark used in COGENT where
  we spend 70% of the query time in here:
  - improved CPU time spent from 15min to 5min
  - increased GC time spent from 5.5min to 6.5min
  - overall decreased total CPU time spent from 23min to 12.5min

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
check-strict-type?:
  Fixed similar to `try-isa-proposition-proof' to not fail on literals with
  complex types such as `(my-favorite-int 42)'.

coerce-incompatible-value:
  Fixed: Handle logic-wrappers with types asserted about them, e.g.,
  `(myint 42)'.  This isn't really a proper coercion, but we need to
  make sure that the coerced value winds up in the proposition, e.g., in
  query expressions.

verify-forall-propositions:
  Improved printing of error message (maybe some of this special
  machinery should be moved into the general printing macros - if they
  aren't already).

evaluate-FUNCTION-term:
  Normalize argument order of sets to pick up duplicates.

deleted-proposition?:
  Performance fix: hand-inline `deleted?', since this is called often
  in `select-relation-propositions'.

clear-caches, reset-powerloom:
  New commands.

logic-form-less?:
  Improved to handle unbound function terms - surfaced with sorting of
  SETOF propositions.

Modified Files:
	optimize.ste 
Log Message:
map-and-enqueue-variable:
  Eliminated safety check to allow bound relation variables such
  as `?county/LA' which are the result of equality constraints between a
  relation variable and a constant or other variable; we ignore the
  binding here and rely on the existence of the appropriate equivalence
  proposition to establish the equivalence during inheritance and
  generate a clash if necessary.  This allows us to now appropriately
  forward-chain relation rules like the following during a subsumption test:

(defrelation r2 ((?point_id GEO) (?county_id GEO) (?taz GEO)) :<=>
  (and 
   (geoPartOf ?point_id ?taz)
   (geoPartOf ?taz ?county_id)
   (= ?county_id g_LA)
   ))

  Here `?county_id' is bound to `g_LA' and during subsumption gets
  further equated with the hypothesized skolem for the second argument.
  Before this set of fixes the equality proposition didn't survive
  which prevented us from getting the necessary equivalence.
  Since the safety level was 3, we didn't break and didn't see this
  problem.

Log Message:
equate-and-simplify-forall-proposition:
  New function derived from `equate-and-simplify-forall-argument'
  that does all the simplification in a single function.  This was
  done primarily to have access to `io-variables' which can then be
  passed to `tighten-argument-bindings'.  This in turn makes some
  equivalence propositions survive that previously were eliminated.
  Having these around is important during forward inference that's run
  as part of relation subsumption where a relation argument is bound to
  a constant.  With the equality we now get the equivalence between the
  hypothetical individual and the constant which previously was missed.
  This is part of a set of fixes to fix the ARGOS relation subsumption
  problem.

derive-satellite-rules:
  Now uses `equate-and-simplify-forall-proposition' in a single call
  to do all the necessary simplification.

Modified Files:
	strategies.ste 
Log Message:
create-anonymous-instance:
  Generalized to generate a regular instance or a skolem.

create-hypothesized-instance:
  We use skolems here to avoid unintentional clashes upon assertion due
  to the unique names assumption.  This could happen, for example, with
  a definition such as the following:
    (defconcept c (?x) :<=> (= ?x the-only-member))
  Now, if we make a hypothetical assertion such as
    (c anonymous-123)
  we would get a clash if `anonymous-123' were a normal object.  Using
  a skolem avoids this problem, since it can be equated to other objects.
  When we make such a hypothetical assertion we say "assume `(c anonymous-123)'
  is true", therefore, we don't want to make this assertion in a way
  that can't be true due to a UNA clash.

add-dependent-proposition-link:

  propositions.  See in-line comments for more detail.
  Eliminated the annoying "Can we eliminate this skolem" warning.

transfer-propositions-except-for:
  Make sure backlinks are added in the appropriate evaluation mode
  and depending on the kind of proposition.  Before this could have been
  called in description mode which caused backlinking errors.

Log Message:
generate-skolem:
  Improved to handle concept prototypes.  This function can cause
  warnings when forward-inferred rules contain skolems (e.g., during
  classification) and the new rule (or description) is checked for
  verbatim equivalents based on the printed representation (see
  descriptions.ste).
  Eventually, this should be fully generalized to also generate
  expressions that can regenerate an arbitrary skolem if necessary
  (see inline comments).

Modified Files:
	descriptions.ste 
Log Message:
ENTITY-MAPPING:
  Doc fix.  With the improved machinery for defined types, we can now
  substitute a different dictionary type here (e.g., KEY-VALUE-MAP) if
  necessary.

equivalent-formulae?:
  Added the reverse lookup here for variables that are mapped onto
  each other in `mapping'.  This wasn't triggered by any bug but by an
  attempt to generalize our equivalence test to not fail if quantified
  variables are supplied in different orders.  To fully generalize
  this more work needs to be done - later.

same-arguments?:
  Changed into `same-and-unique-arguments?' which now additionally
  checks that there are no duplicate variables in the two vectors.

find-duplicate-named-description:
  Now uses `same-and-unique-arguments?' to not pick up a named
  description by mistake if we have duplicate variables.  For example,
  `(kappa (?x ?y) (and (r ?x ?y) (= ?x ?y)))' becomes
  `(kappa (?x ?x) (r ?x ?x)' which is not the same as `r'.

*stringified-description-index*, deleted-logic-object?,
uniquify-description-variables, restore-description-variable-names,
cons-tree-less-than?, sort-proposition-clauses,
uniquify-proposition-tree, help-collect-constant-references,
collect-constant-description-references,
find-duplicate-description-with-constant-reference:
  Removed, since we totally revamped the lookup of duplicate
  descriptions.

find-exact-duplicate-description:
  Changed into `find-duplicate-complex-description' which uses the new
  structured objects index to find duplicates.
  This new version eliminates some "don't know how to generate
  skolem" warnings in the test-suite, because we don't stringify
  anymore.

find-duplicate-description:
  Streamlined with help of new `find-duplicate-complex-description'.

Totally revampled normalization of top-level equivalences, to avoid
fastening down before we do that.  Otherwise, an already fastened-down
description/rule which has already been stored in the new object index
could be destructively modified by this further normalization which
would then prevent us to find duplicates later.

collapse-value-of-chains-for-io-variables:
  Now called by new 'normalize-top-level-descriptive-proposition'.
  Minorly streamlined.

collapse-value-of-chains:
  Removed, since now obsolete.

tighten-argument-bindings:
  Now avoids the unfastening/fastening which might put a copy of the
  proposition into the structured object index and then further
  destructively modify it.
  This should probably go into normalize.ste

equate-top-level-equivalences:
  Simply moved to where it belongs.
  This should probably go into normalize.ste

finish-building-description:
  Use new `normalize-top-level' which will do the simplification of
  variable chains without fastening, so the duplicate check that comes
  later will find duplicates if there are any.
  Slightly stream-lined duplicate check.

evaluate-DESCRIPTION-term:
  Stream-lined duplicate check.

collect-free-variables:
  Fixed: this now collects free variables in the order they are
  encountered which is relied upon by `create-forward-chaining-index'.

Modified Files:
	optimize.ste 
Log Message:
argument-bound?:
  Now calls the slightly more expensive `quantified-argument-bound?'
  if necessary, to not report a quantified variable as unbound.

quantified-argument-bound?:
  Just like `argument-bound?' but also considers quantified variables
  introduced by quantified argument propositions.
  Having the separate version saves the extra complexity for the
  far less common case.

mapped-value-of:
  Fixed to not break on internal variables of KAPPA's when we see
  a parent query iterator (I think this fixes the problem with
  calling `subset-of' on KAPPA's, but I forgot now).

inherit-proposition-argument:
  Properly coerce STELLA relations to their logic descriptions.

inherit-proposition:
  Don't call `find-similar-proposition' anymore since we don't really
  seem to need it and it now causes a bug with some of the PSYASE
  translation stuff due to improved normalization.  In general, calling
  `find-similar-proposition' seems primarily an "optimization"
  that avoids generating duplicate propositions; however, since
  we've improved our duplicate detection machinery, we might want
  to eliminate it alltogether, since it is an expensive function,
  particularly, if we have high-fanout backlinks.

inherit-as-top-level-proposition:
  Use new `normalize-top-level-proposition'.

map-and-enqueue-variable?:
  Now returns TRUE if the mapping was successful or FALSE if there was
  a clash.  Now checks for a potential clash, since if we have
  non-unique io-variables (due to collapsed identity constraints),
  we need to ensure that we are not violating a previous binding.
  Handles rules like this: (=>> (and (= ?x ?y) (r1 ?x ?y)) (r2 ?x ?y))
  - see test-suite "FORWARD INFERENCE BUG"

map-functional-value?:
  Now returns TRUE if the mapping was successful or FALSE if there was
  clash (just passes through the result of `map-and-enqueue-variable?').

inherit-description-propositions:
  Exploit new return values of `map-and-enqueue-variable?' and
  `map-functional-value?'.

Modified Files:
	propagate.ste 
Log Message:
apply-rule-consequent-to-vector:
  Extracted rule printing and improved it for the case of complex
  forward rules (printing the trigger description with the supplied
  arguments wouldn't necessarily print a correct proposition, since the
  consequent could have had a lot more and different args).  Also, we
  now print multiple consequents in an AND instead of repeating the rule
  over and over.

trace-forward-rule:
  New function to trace application of a forward rule (see above).

apply-forward-rules-to-vector:
  Improved interaction between backward inference tracing and the
  backward inference triggered for cases where we have complex forward
  rules.  If we are not tracing forward inference but backward goal
  tracing is on, turn it off temporarily since the output can be
  distracting.

evaluate-FUNCTION-proposition:
  If we have a computed value in description mode (e.g., when a
  description gets finalized), make sure we substitute a surrogate if
  appropriate to avoid a backlink from the computed object to the
  description.

Update of /home/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/logic
In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv7100

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
LOGIC-OBJECT.dependent-descriptions:
  Removed this kludge, since the new mechanism for finding duplicates
  of complex descriptions doesn't need this anymore.

{LOGIC-OBJECT, PROPOSITION}.home-context:
  Add initializer to always allocate objects in modules rather than
  the current context.  Otherwise, objects can be allocated in
  volatile inference worlds and destroyed when those worlds are
  destroyed.  In some cases this is desirable as a clean-up
  operation, however, there are others where this can lead to very
  strange and difficult to debug bugs.  So, for now we always create
  objects at the module level, and the only thing that changes in
  inference worlds is assertion status.  If cleanup is required it can
  be done manually, or by introducing a separate inference module that
  gets explicitly cleared in regular intervals.

variable?:
  Robustified to also handle NULL objects.

*stringified-proposition-index*, find-exact-duplicate-proposition:
  Eliminated in favor of new duplicate detection scheme.

*structured-objects-index*, cleanup-structured-objects-index,
proposition-hash-index, find-duplicate-complex-proposition:
  New definitions to support new duplicate detection scheme for
  propositions and descriptions (see file for more info).

find-duplicate-proposition:
  Now use `find-duplicate-complex-proposition' to find/store all
  propositions (not just complex ones).

help-fasten-down-propositions:
  For :FORALL and :EXISTS propositions don't try to structure-share
  their arguments, since later simplification or other destructive
  modification could screw things up too easily and create very
  strange bugs.

build-top-level-proposition:
  Use new `normalize-top-level-proposition' for normalization.

build-and-or-not-proposition:
  Catch empty NOT proposition and signal error.

verify-forall-propositions:
  Downgraded error to a warning, since in some cases with
  equivalences and normalization such quantification can occur and
  make sense.

find-duplicate-function-proposition:
  Simplified, since the new `find-duplicate-proposition' handles
  function propositions as well.

deleted-proposition?:
  Commented the complex logic that further deletes the proposition in
  case the home context was deleted, since it doesn't gain us that much
  but can cause very strange bugs, since sub-propositions that might
  have been conceived while in an inference cache might unexpectedly be
  deleted by this function when the proposition gets printed somewhere,
  etc.  Instead, implement proper cleanup functions that utilize the new
  *structured-objects-index* which allows us to find all propositions
  asserted or inferred.  Since we now allocate all propositions at the
  module level, the significance of this change might have gone away.

clear-logic-module-hook:
  Changed to cleanup new structured objects index.

In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv7856

Modified Files:
	query.ste 
Log Message:
QUERY-ITERATOR.initial-bindings:
  New slot to better support reuse/reset of cached query iterators.
  This is primarily used to pass new initial bindings to the `reset'
  method, so we don't have to duplicate some of the reset logic in
  `make-cached-query'.

change-pattern-variable-binding:
  New - somewhat esotheric - function.

argument-bound-to:
  Streamlined with help of new `find-duplicate-description'.

help-bind-variable-to-value?:
unless (eql? boundToValue (value-of boundToValue))
  In some cases the elaboration might discover additional
  equivalences, and in those cases we change the binding of the
  variable here to point to the the newly discovered equivalent
  representative.
  We could do that when the bindings are collected at the top-level
  but that would prevent us from ever retrieving all members of an
  equivalence class (not implemented yet).

all-arguments-bound?, all-key-arguments-bound?:
  Improved with help of new `quantified-argument-bound?' which takes
  quantified variables into account and doesn't erroneously report those
  as unbound.

initialize-query-iterator:
  Record initial bindings if we had some.

try-to-defeat-last-answer?:
  Initialize initial bindings slot for the negated query so `reset'
  will automatically do the right thing.

QUERY-ITERATOR.reset:
  Improved: now also resets to previously stored `initial-bindings'.

make-cached-query:
  Performance fix: we don't have to re-optimize if we use dynamic
  optimization;  also fixed test to determine whether binding pattern
  changed - previous test was faulty and always succeeded which caused
  the bad performance in the first place.
  Streamlined.
  Folded variable rebinding logic into `reset', since we have to do
  the frame overlay with the pattern AFTER the new bindings are
  assigned, which means we can't call `reset' after the variables get
  bound and need `reset' to do it all.  Before, we didn't run into
  this problem, since the incorrect logic never reused a cached iterator.

Modified Files:

Log Message:
equate-and-simplify-forall-proposition:
  Removed, since this is now handled by
  `normalize-top-leve-proposition'.

derive-satellite-rules:
  Removed call to `equate-and-simplify-forall-proposition', since we
  have to do this during normalization to not fool the new duplicate
  detection scheme.

remove-exists-variable:
  Removed, since obsolete.

create-forward-chaining-index:
  Fixed and stream-lined: removal of non-consequent io-variables
  caused probles with destructive modification of the list we
  were iterating over which in some cases generated incorrect lists.

print-rules:
  Now pretty-prints rules and only reports true rules.  If we want all
  rules we might want to add a `:true-only?' option at some point.

Log Message:
/PL-KERNEL-KB/HOLDS-specialist:
  Generalized to provide an `all-facts-of'-style result in case the
  relation variable is unbound.

non-recursive-single-valued-term?, single-valued-goal?,
help-single-valued-goal?, help-collect-singly-bound-variables:
  Improved, to - in effect - allow `single-valued-goal?' to be called
  recursively (needed by the query engine) and non-recursively (needed
  by `non-recursive-single-valued-term?').
  This solves an infinite recursion problem with rules such as
    (=> (R ?X ?Y) (EXISTS (?Z) (R ?X ?Z)))
  which caused `(single-valued-term? R)' to go into infinite
  recursion.

/PL-KERNEL-KB/name-to-object-computation:
  New object creation specialist.

/PL-KERNEL-KB/DIFFERENT-specialist:
  Improved to not punt on skolem arguments but instead check whether
  their values are all different.

Log Message:
In golf-handicap test-case, reenabled `propagate-constraints', since
we need that to get the required equality inference.  Also handled an
additional case with different assertion order.  Before, we
surrepetitiously got one answer due to overzelous evaluation of
function output arguments when the proposition was built (the new
duplicate detection scheme where we hold off on that brought that bug
back to light).

Various new test cases from recent bugs and additions of new features.
