This is a catch-all section for documented functions, methods and
relations that haven't been categorized yet into any of the previous
sections.  They are in random order and many of them will never be part
of the official PowerLoom interface.  So beware!

          (score PARTIAL-MATCH-SCORE)) :
     Add a query and score pair to the master list of   testing examples

 -- N-Command: add-training-example ((form CONS)
          (score PARTIAL-MATCH-SCORE)) :
     Add a query and score pair to the master list of   training
     examples

 -- Function: all-asserted-types ((self OBJECT)) : (CONS OF
          NAMED-DESCRIPTION)
     Return a set of all of the types that are asserted to be satisfied
     by SELF.

          CONS)
     Return a list of lists of descriptions that are provably
     co-extensional.

 -- Function: all-direct-subrelations ((relation NAMED-DESCRIPTION)
          (removeEquivalents? BOOLEAN)) : (CONS OF NAMED-DESCRIPTION)
     Return a set of relations that immediately specialize RELATION.
     If REMOVEEQUIVALENTS? (recommended), don't include any relations
     equivalent to RELATION.

 -- Function: all-direct-superrelations ((relation NAMED-DESCRIPTION)
          (removeEquivalents? BOOLEAN)) : (CONS OF NAMED-DESCRIPTION)
     Return a set of relations that immediately subsume RELATION.  If
     REMOVEEQUIVALENTS? (recommended), don't include any relations
     equivalent to RELATION.

 -- Function: all-direct-types ((self OBJECT)) : (CONS OF LOGIC-OBJECT)
     Return a set of most specific types that are satisfied by SELF.

 -- Function: all-equivalent-relations ((relation NAMED-DESCRIPTION)
          (reflexive? BOOLEAN)) : (CONS OF NAMED-DESCRIPTION)

     REFLEXIVE?, include RELATION in the list.

 -- Function: all-facts-of-instance ((self OBJECT)
          (includeunknownfacts? BOOLEAN) (elaborate? BOOLEAN)) : (LIST
          OF PROPOSITION)
     Return a list of all definite (TRUE or FALSE) propositions
     attached to SELF.

 -- N-Command: all-facts-of-n ((n INTEGER) &rest (instanceRefs NAME)) :
          (CONS OF PROPOSITION)
     This is a generalization of `all-facts-of' (which see).  With N = 0
     and only one instance this command behaves just like
     `all-facts-of'.  Otherwise, returns a cons list of all definite
     (TRUE or FALSE) propositions that reference any of the instances
     listed in INSTANCEREFS, plus if N >= 1 all propositions that
     reference any instances that are arguments of propositions
     collected in the previous step, plus if N >= 2... and so on.  That
     is, if we only consider binary propositions, this can be viewed as
     growing a graph with instances as its nodes and predicates as its
     arcs starting from the set of seed INSTANCEREFS to depth N-1.
     Caution: with a fully connected KB and large enough N this could
     return the whole knowledge base.

     The returned propositions include those asserted to be true or
     false by default, but it does not include propositions that are
     found to be true only by running the query engine.  Facts inferred
     to be true by the forward chainer will be included.  Hence, the
     returned list of facts may be longer in a context where the
     forward chainer has been run then in one where it has not (see
     `run-forward-rules').

 -- Function: all-inconsistent-propositions ((module MODULE)
          (local? BOOLEAN)) : (ITERATOR OF PROPOSITION)

     MODULE.

 -- Function: all-named-terms ((module MODULE) (local? BOOLEAN)) :
          (ITERATOR OF OBJECT)

     haven't been deleted will be considered.  If LOCAL?, only return
     terms created locally in MODULE.

 -- Function: all-propositions ((module MODULE) (local? BOOLEAN)) :
          (ITERATOR OF PROPOSITION)
     Iterate over all conceived propositions visible from MODULE.  Only
     propositions that haven't been deleted will be considered.  If
     LOCAL?, only return propositions conceived locally in MODULE.

 -- Function: all-relation-values ((relation SURROGATE)
          (nMinusOneArguments CONS)) : CONS

 -- Function: apply-kappa? ((description DESCRIPTION) (vector VECTOR))
          : BOOLEAN

     `apply-kappa?'.

 -- Macro: apply-retrieve (&body (body CONS)) : OBJECT
     Execute a query composed of io-variables `variables' and body
     `queryBody'.  Before executing, bind variables to `inputBindings'
     (in sequence). If one variable is left unbound, returns a cons
     list of bindings of that variable.  If two or more are unbound,
     returns a cons list of cons lists of bindings.  Setting the option
     :singletons?  to FALSE always returns a list of lists.  Example
     call:   `(apply-retrieve variables queryBody inputBindings)'

 -- N-Command: ask-partial (&rest (proposition&options PARSE-TREE)) :
          FLOAT
     Similar to `ask' (which see), but return the highest partial match
     score for the supplied proposition instead of a truth value.  If
     the option :MAXIMIZE-SCORE? is set to FALSE, return after the

     expressions.

 -- Function: call-run-forward-rules ((module MODULE) (force? BOOLEAN))
          :
     Run forward inference rules in module MODULE. If MODULE is NULL,
     the current module will be used.  If forward inferencing is already
     up-to-date in the designated module, no additional inferencing
     will occur, unless FORCE? is set to TRUE, in which case all

     Return a CONS tree representation of the proof SELF.  Each proof
     step is represented as a CONS tree of the form   (<proposition>
     (<key> <value>...) <antecedent>...)  where each <antecedent> is a
     CONS tree representing a subproof.  The consification follows the
     original proof structure literally, i.e., no uninteresting nodes
     such as patterns or AND-introductions are suppressed.

 -- Method on QUERY-ITERATOR: consify (self) : CONS
     Generate all solutions for the query self, and collect them into a
     cons list of result tuples.  If `:SINGLETONS? TRUE', collect a
     list of atoms rather than a list of lists for tuples of arity=1.

 -- Function: consify-justification ((self JUSTIFICATION)
          (style KEYWORD)) : CONS
     Return a CONS tree representation of the proof SELF.  Each proof
     step is represented as a CONS tree of the form   (<proposition>
     (<key> <value>...) <antecedent>...)  where each <antecedent> is a
     CONS tree representing a subproof.  STYLE indicates what nodes in
     the proof tree should be suppressed.  :RAW preserves the original
     structure literally, :VERBOSE keeps AND- introductions but
     suppresses all auxiliary (non-logical) nodes such as pattern
     nodes, and :BRIEF additionally suppresses AND-introduction nodes.

 -- Function: constant? ((objectRef OBJECT)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if OBJECTREF denotes a literal or scalar.

 -- Method on JUSTIFICATION: copy (self) : (LIKE SELF)
     Return a copy of the proof starting at SELF.  Allocates all new
     justification objects, but structure-shares other information such
     as propositions and substitutions.

 -- N-Command: create ((name GENERALIZED-SYMBOL)
          &rest (type GENERALIZED-SYMBOL)) : OBJECT

 -- Function: create-2_d_float-array ((nof-rows INTEGER)
          (nof-columns INTEGER) &rest (values FLOAT)) : 2_D_FLOAT-ARRAY
     Create a two-dimensional array with NOF-ROWS rows and NOF-COLUMNS
     columns, and initialize it in row-major-order from VALUES.

     ignored.

 -- Function: create-float-vector (&rest (values FLOAT)) : FLOAT-VECTOR
     Return a vector containing VALUES, in order.

 -- Function: create-marker-storage ((supportRecall? BOOLEAN)) :
          MARKER-TABLE
     Return a new marker storage object, used to remember with objects
     have been `marked'.  If SUPPORTRECALL?  is set, then the iterator
     `recall-marked-objects' can be invoked on the new marker storage
     object.

 -- Function: create-vector (&rest (values OBJECT)) : VECTOR
     Return a vector containing VALUES, in order.

 -- Command: current-inference-level () : NORMAL-INFERENCE-LEVEL

 -- Macro: define-arithmetic-operation-on-wrappers ((name SYMBOL)
          (operation-name SYMBOL)) : OBJECT
     Defines NAME as an arithmetic comparision operation using the test
     `test-name'.  It will take two wrapped number parameters and
     return a wrapped number.  The code will use the appropriate test
     for the specific subtype of wrapped number actually passed in, and
     return the appropriate subtype of wrapped number based on the
     normal arithmetic contagion rules.

     For example, if both input parameters are wrapped integers then
     the output will be a wrapped integer.  If the inputs are a wrapped
     integer and a wrapped float then the output will be a wrapped
     float, etc.

 -- Macro: define-arithmetic-test-on-wrappers ((name SYMBOL)
          (test-name SYMBOL)) : OBJECT
     Defines NAME as an arithmetic comparision operation using the test
     TEST-NAME.  It will take two wrapped number parameters and return
     a `boolean'.  The code will use the appropriate test for the
     specific subtype of wrapped number actually passed in.

 -- Macro: define-computed-constraint ((name SYMBOL) (var-list CONS)
          (constraint-test CONS) &body (position-computations CONS)) :
          OBJECT
     Defines NAME to be a constraint computation which uses
     CONSTRAINT-TEST to determine if a fully bound set of variables
     satisfies the constraint.  The forms in POSITION-COMPUTATIONS are
     used to compute the value for each of the positions. All such
     computations must set the variable `value' to be the result
     computed for the missing position.  Setting `value' to `null' for
     any such computation means that that particular argument cannot be
     computed from the others.  The input variables in VAR-LIST will be
     bound to the N arguments to the constraint.    The generated
     function will return a Stella Object and take as inputs the values
     of the N arguments to the constraint.  A value of `null' means
     that the value is not available.  If all arguments are not `null',
     then the return value will be a Stella wrapped boolean indicating
     whether the constraint is satisified or not.    If more than one
     input value is `null', then this constraint code will not be
     called.

 -- Function: deobjectify-tree ((self OBJECT)) : OBJECT
     Return a copy of SELF where all logic objects are replaced by
     their `generated' parse-tree version.  This is useful to convert
     the result of a retrieval query into a regular parse tree.

 -- Method on NAMED-DESCRIPTION: describe-object (self
          (stream OUTPUT-STREAM) (mode KEYWORD)) :
     Prints a description of SELF to stream STREAM.  MODE can be
     :terse, :verbose, or :source.  Used by `describe'.

     Return the name of the description SELF.

 -- Method on DESCRIPTION: description-name (self) : SYMBOL
     Return the name of the description SELF, if it has one.

     `deleted?', thereby making it invisible within class extensions.

 -- Function: destroy-object ((self OBJECT)) :
     Destroy SELF which can be a term or a proposition.  Destroy all
     propositions that reference SELF and mark it as `deleted?' (thereby
     making it invisible within class extensions).

 -- Function: destroy-proposition ((proposition PROPOSITION)) :
          PROPOSITION
     Retract and destroy the proposition PROPOSITION.  Recursively
     destroy all propositions that reference PROPOSITION.  Also,
     destroy all satellite propositions of PROPOSITION.

 -- Method on OBJECT-STORE: fetch-instance (store (name OBJECT)) :
          OBJECT
     Fetch the instance identified by NAME (a string or symbol) from
     STORE and return it as an appropriate logic object.  This needs to
     be appropriately specialized on actual OBJECT-STORE
     implementations.

 -- Method on OBJECT-STORE: fetch-relation (store (name OBJECT)) :
          NAMED-DESCRIPTION
     Fetch the relation identified by NAME (a string or symbol) from

          DESCRIPTION) (CONS OF DESCRIPTION)
     Classify SELF and return three values, its direct supers, direct
     subs, and a list of equivalent descriptions.  Setting
     `supersOnly?' may speed up the computation (perhaps by a lot).  If
     `description' is nameless and has no dependent propositions, then
     it is automatically removed from the hierarchy after
     classification.

 -- Function: find-direct-supers-of-instance ((self OBJECT)) : (CONS OF

     surrogate.  If INSTANCEREF is a surrogate, the search originates
     in the module the surrogate was interned in.

 -- N-Command: find-rule ((ruleName NAME)) : PROPOSITION
     Search for a rule named RULENAME.  Like `get-rule', but
     `find-rule' implicity quotes its input argument.

     Method to generate a specialized term for SELF.  This is designed
     to allow for extension of the term generation code to cover other
     types of objects for the logic.  This particular method will signal
     an error unless there is a surrogate-value-inverse link set.

 -- Function: get-class ((instanceRef OBJECT)) : LOGIC-OBJECT
     Return the nearest class with name INSTANCEREF visible from the
     current module.  INSTANCEREF can be a string, symbol, or

     Used to convert a computation to reference so-called `template'
     slots rather than `own' slots:  If INSTANCEREF denotes a class,
     return a prototype of that class.  Otherwise, return INSTANCEREF.

 -- Function: get-slot-maximum-cardinality ((self LOGIC-OBJECT)
          (relation SURROGATE)) : INTEGER
     Return a maximum value for the number of fillers of relation
     RELATION (a surrogate) applied to the instance SELF (an object).

     Return the number of entries in SELF.

 -- Command: list-features () : LIST
     Return a list containing two lists, a list of currently enabled
     PowerLoom features, and a list of all available PowerLoom features.

 -- Method on QUERY-ITERATOR: listify (self) : LIST
     Just like `QUERY-ITERATOR.consify' but return a LIST instead.

 -- Command: load-cmd-line-files () :
     Loads all PowerLoom files specified on the command line.  If
     directories are listed, all PowerLoom files in those directories
     are loaded.  Since when this is called we might still have
     unprocessed command line args, this only looks at files which are
     to the right of the last argument that starts with a `-' character.

 -- Command: load-directory ((directory STRING)) :
     Load all PowerLoom files (*.plm) in DIRECTORY in alphabetic sort
     order.

          (default-module MODULE)) :
     Read logic commands from STREAM and evaluate them.  If
     DEFAULT-MODULE is not `null', then any commands will be read into
     that module unless an `in-module' declaration is encountered which
     will over-ride the default value.  If noe DEFAULT-MODULE is
     specified, and the input stream does not have an `in-module' form,
     an error is signaled.

 -- Function: logic-class? ((self CLASS)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if the class SELF or one of its supers supports
     indices that record extensions referenced by the logic system.
     Also return true for literal classes.

     A sorting predicate for objects O1 and O2 that can appear in
     logical forms.  Performs a combined numeric and lexocographic sort
     that accounts for lists, collections and propositions.  Numbers
     precede all other values, `null' follows all other values.

 -- Function: logic-module? ((self MODULE)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if SELF is a logic module, implying that relations
     defined within it define a knowledge base.  A module is a logic
     module iff it inherits the module `PL-KERNEL'.

 -- Method on QUERY-SOLUTION-TABLE: lookup (self
          (key (LIKE (ANY-KEY SELF)))) : (LIKE (ANY-VALUE SELF))
     Lookup the solution identified by KEY in SELF and return its
     value, or NULL if no such solution exists.

     by the computation specialist.

 -- Function: lookup-native-specialist ((native-name STRING)) :
          FUNCTION-CODE
     Returns the native funtion code for NATIVE-NAME if it exists and
     the underlying programming languages supports such lookups.  Uses
     the signature of a specialist function.

 -- Function: merge-truth-values ((tv1 TRUTH-VALUE) (tv2 TRUTH-VALUE))
          : TRUTH-VALUE
     Merge two truth values that are describing the "same" logical
     proposition.  This handles subordination of default to strict
     values, known over unknown and potential inconsistent values.

     In particular, this can be used to check for negated values by
     asking for the truth of a proposition and its negation, inverting
     the negation and then using merge to come up with an answer.

 -- Function: named-description? ((self DESCRIPTION)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if SELF is the description of a named class or
     relation.

          (stream NATIVE-OUTPUT-STREAM)) :
     Print the array SELF to STREAM.

 -- Method on 2_D_FLOAT-ARRAY: print-array (self
          (stream NATIVE-OUTPUT-STREAM)) :

 -- Function: print-extension-sizes ((module MODULE)
          (sizeCutoff INTEGER)) :
     Print the extension sizes of concepts visible in MODULE.  If

     extensions with size less than SIZECUTOFF (default is 10).

 -- N-Command: print-facts ((instanceref OBJECT)) :
     Like `all-facts-of', but sorts and prints each fact on a separate
     line on the standard output stream.

 -- Function: print-goal-stack ((frame CONTROL-FRAME)
          (verbose? BOOLEAN)) :
     Print stack of goals.  Assumes that query has been interrupted
     with a full stack of control frames.

 -- Function: print-logical-form ((form OBJECT) (stream OUTPUT-STREAM))
          :
     Print the logical form FORM to STREAM according to the current
     setting of `*logic-dialect*'.  Pretty-printing is controlled by
     the current setting of `*prettyPrintLogicalForms?*'.

 -- Function: print-logical-form-in-dialect ((self OBJECT)
          (dialect KEYWORD) (stream OUTPUT-STREAM)) :
     Produce a stringified version of a logical representation of SELF
     and write it to the stream STREAM.  Use the dialect DIALECT, or

 -- Function: print-unformatted-logical-form ((form OBJECT)
          (stream OUTPUT-STREAM)) :
     Print the logical form FORM to STREAM according to the current
     setting of `*logic-dialect*'.  Pretty-printing is explicitly
     forced to be turned off.

 -- Function: register-computation-function ((name STRING)
          (code FUNCTION-CODE) (arity INTEGER)) :
     Creates a registration entry for NAME as a computation which
     executes CODE.  Essentially just builds the Stella meta-information
     tructure needed to funcall NAME as a computation function by the
     computation specialist.  The function definition in CODE needs to
     accept ARITY Stella OBJECTs as arguments and return a Stella OBJECT
     suitable for PowerLoom use.  (These are generally LOGIC-OBJECTs
     and the literal wrappers FLOAT-WRAPPER, INTEGER-WRAPPER and
     STRING-WRAPPER.)

 -- Command: register-computation-function-name ((stella-name STRING)
          (native-name STRING) (arity INTEGER)) :
     registers a computation function STELLA-NAME based on the
     NATIVE-NAME for the particular programming language in question.
     Use of this command makes the resulting code or knowledge bases
     non-portable to other target languages.

 -- Function: register-logic-dialect-print-function ((dialect KEYWORD)
          (fn FUNCTION-CODE-WRAPPER)) :
     Register FN as a logic-object print function for DIALECT.  Each
     function should have the signature `((self OBJECT) (stream
     OUTPUT-STREAM))'.  Any return values will be ignored.

 -- Function: register-specialist-function ((name STRING)
          (code FUNCTION-CODE)) :
     Creates a registration entry for NAME as a specialist which
     executes CODE.  Essentially just builds the Stella meta-information
     tructure needed to funcall NAME as a specialist.  The function
     definition in CODE needs to accept a CONTROL-FRAME and KEYWORD as
     arguments and return a KEYWORD.  Side effects on elements of the
     proposition in the control frame can be used to bind and thus
     return values.

 -- Command: register-specialist-function-name ((stella-name STRING)
          (native-name STRING)) :
     registers a specialist function STELLA-NAME based on the
     NATIVE-NAME for the particular programming language in question.
     Use of this command makes the resulting code or knowledge bases
     non-portable to other target languages.

     solution ordering chain, the solution is marked as deleted and
     will be completely removed upon the next iteration through SELF.

 -- Method on PAGING-INDEX: remove-deleted-members (self) : (LIKE SELF)
     Destructively remove all deleted members of SELF.

 -- Function: reset-clash-exceptions () :
     Resets the collection of clash exceptions

 -- Function: reset-query-caches () :
     Zero out all caches managed by the query optimizer, so that it
     will reoptimize subgoal queries upon next invocation.

 -- Function: retract-facts-of-instance ((self LOGIC-OBJECT)) :
     Retract all definite (TRUE or FALSE) propositions attached to SELF.

 -- N-Command: retrieve-partial (&rest (tree PARSE-TREE)) :
          QUERY-ITERATOR
     Partial-match version of `retrieve' (which see) that generates
     scored partial solutions based on the current partial match
     strategy.  By supplying `BEST' instead of `ALL', or by adding the
     option `:SORT-BY :SCORE', the generated solutions will be sorted
     so that solutions with higher scores come first.  Use the
     `:MATCH-MODE' option to override the global default setting
     established by `set-partial-match-mode', e.g., use `:MATCH-MODE
     :NN' to use the neural net partial match mode.  The
     `:MINIMUM-SCORE' option can be used to only retrieve solutions
     that have at least the specified minimum match score.  By default,
     `retrieve-partial' does not maximize the match scores of its
     returned bindings.  To only get maximal scores use
     `:MAXIMIZE-SCORE? TRUE' (this is not yet implemented - you can use
     `ask-partial' to maximize scores for individual solutions by hand).

 -- N-Command: run-forward-rules (&rest (options OBJECT)) :
     Run forward inference rules in the module defined by the :module
     option (which defaults to the current module).  If forward
     inferencing is already up-to-date in the designated module, no
     additional inferencing will occur, unless the :force?  option is
     specified as TRUE, in which case all forward rules are run or
     rerun.  For backwards compatibility, this command also supports
     the old <module> :force arguments specified with a non-standard
     keyword notation.

     Calling `run-forward-rules' temporarily puts the module into a
     mode where future assertional (monotonic) updates will trigger
     additional forward inference.  Once a non-monotonic update is
     performed, i.e., a retraction or clipping of relation value, all
     cached forward inferences will be discarded and forward
     inferencing will be disabled until this function is called again.

 -- Command: run-powerloom-tests () :
     Run the PowerLoom test suite.  Currently this simply runs all
     demos and echos commands and their results to standard output.
     The output can then be diffed with previously validated runs to
     find deviations.

 -- Function: satisfies? ((instanceOrTuple OBJECT)
          (relationRef OBJECT)) : TRUTH-VALUE
     Try to prove whether INSTANCEORTUPLE satisfies the definition of
     the relation RELATIONREF and return the result truth value of the
     query.  INSTANCEORTUPLE can be a single object, the name or
     surrogate of an object, or a collection (a list or vector) of
     objects.  RELATIONREF can be a relation, description, surrogate or
     relation name.

 -- Command: save-all-neural-networks ((file STRING)) :
     Save all neural networks to FILE (if FILE is non-NULL).  If
     networks are saved periodically (see `set-save-network-cycle')
     this file name will be used to perform periodic saves.

 -- Function: select-proof-result ((success? BOOLEAN)
          (continuing? BOOLEAN) (terminal? BOOLEAN)) : KEYWORD
     Helping function for specialists.   Return the appropriate keyword
     indicating success or failure of a proof.

 -- Function: select-test-result ((success? BOOLEAN)
          (terminal? BOOLEAN) (frame CONTROL-FRAME)) : KEYWORD
     Helping function for specialists testing the validity of a fully
     bound inference frame.  Based on the test result SUCCESS?  and
     `reversePolarity?*', set the truth value of FRAME and return an
     appropriate keyword.  The keyword will be either `:final-success'
     `:terminal-failure' if TERMINAL? is true.  Otherwise it will be
     `:final-success' or `:failure'.

 -- Command: set-error-print-cycle ((i INTEGER)) :
     Set number of cycles between which error rates are saved to the
     file established by the last call to `save-all-neural-networks'
     appended with extension `.err'.  A number <= 0 (or NULL) turns off
     periodic saving.

 -- N-Command: set-inference-level ((level NAME) (module NAME)) :
          KEYWORD
     Set the inference level of MODULE to the level specified by
     `levelKeyword'.  If MODULE is NULL, set the level globally.

     Set number of cycles between which networks are saved to the file
     established by the last call to `save-all-neural-networks'.  A
     number <= 0 or a NULL number turns off periodic saving.

 -- Method on QUERY-SOLUTION-TABLE: sort (self
          (predicate FUNCTION-CODE)) : (LIKE SELF)
     Perform a stable, destructive sort of SELF according to PREDICATE,
     and return the result.  If PREDICATE has a `<' semantics, the
     result will be in ascending order.

 -- Function: specializes? ((subObject OBJECT) (superObject OBJECT)) :
          TRUTH-VALUE
     Try to prove if the description associated with SUBOBJECT
     specializes the description for SUPEROBJECT and return the result
     truth value of the query.

 -- Command: start-ontosaurus (&rest (options OBJECT)) :
     Start the PowerLoom HTTP server at :port (defaults to 9090).  Loads
     the required support systems in Lisp and Java if necessary (C++ is
     not yet supported).

 -- Command: start-powerloom-gui (&rest (options OBJECT)) :
     Start the PowerLoom server at :port (defaults to 9090) and launches
     the GUI which will communicate with the server at that port.  If
     :host is specified, the GUI will try to communicate with a server
     at `host:port' instead of the local embedded server (note, you can
     always point the GUI manually to a different server from its
     `Connect to Server' menu item).  Loads the required support
     systems if necessary.  Embedded calls to the GUI are currently
     only supported in Java; however, when the GUI is run in standalone
     mode, it can communicate with any PowerLoom installation that
     supports an HTTP server (currently Lisp and Java).

 -- Command: start-powerloom-server (&rest (options OBJECT)) :
     Start the PowerLoom HTTP server at :port (defaults to 9090).  Loads
     the required support systems in Lisp and Java if necessary (C++ is
     not yet supported).

 -- Command: stop-ontosaurus () :
     Stop the PowerLoom HTTP server and free up any bound ports.  This
     is a no-op if no server is running or the server is not supported.

 -- Command: stop-powerloom-gui () :
     Closes the PowerLoom GUI application if it is currently visible.
     This is a no-op if the GUI is not running or if it is not
     supported.

 -- Command: stop-powerloom-server () :
     Stop the PowerLoom HTTP server and free up any bound ports.  This
     is a no-op if no server is running or the server is not supported.

 -- Function: strengthen-truth-value ((tv1 TRUTH-VALUE)
          (tv2 TRUTH-VALUE)) : TRUTH-VALUE
     If TV2 has greater strength than TV1, adapt the strength of TV1
     (not its value!) and return the result.  Otherwise, return TV1
     unmodified.

 -- Function: strict-truth-value? ((self TRUTH-VALUE)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if SELF is a strict truth value.

 -- Function: stronger-truth-value? ((tv1 TRUTH-VALUE)
          (tv2 TRUTH-VALUE)) : BOOLEAN
     Compare the two truth values and return `true' if TV1 is strictly
     stronger than TV2.  Stronger uses the following partial order:
     INCONSISTENT > STRICT > DEFAULT > UNKNOWN.  Truth values at the
     same level are equal in strength.

 -- Function: termify ((self OBJECT)) : OBJECT
     Convert SELF into an equivalent PowerLoom object that can be
     passed as an argument wherever an instance is expected.

 -- Function: test-closed-slot? ((relation SURROGATE)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if RELATION (a surrogate) is asserted to be closed or
     if the current module closes all relations.

 -- Function: test-function-slot? ((relation SURROGATE)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if RELATION (a surrogate) is a function.

 -- Method on MARKER-TABLE: test-marker? (self (object OBJECT)) :
          BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if OBJECT is stored (marked) in SELF.

 -- Function: test-relation-on-arguments? ((relation SURROGATE)
          (arguments CONS)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if RELATION (a surrogate) is TRUE when applied to
     ARGUMENTS.

 -- Function: test-slot-value? ((self LOGIC-OBJECT)
          (relation SURROGATE) (filler OBJECT)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if the proposition `(<relation> <self> <filler>)' is
     true.

 -- Function: test-special-marker-table? ((self OBJECT)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if the object SELF is stored (marked) in the table
     pointed at by the special variable *specialMarkerTable*.  Designed
     for use by `remove-if'.

 -- Function: test-subrelation? ((subrelation SURROGATE)
          (superrelation SURROGATE)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if SUBRELATION specializes SUPERRELATION.

 -- Function: test-type-on-instance? ((self OBJECT) (type SURROGATE)) :
          BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if SELF satisfies TYPE.

 -- Command: translate-loom-file ((input FILE-NAME) (output FILE-NAME))
          :
     Translate the Loom file INPUT to PowerLoom and write the
     translation to the file OUTPUT.  Note that this will only work for
     fairly vanilla Loom files that do not contain any Lisp-isms.  It
     might require to clean the Loom file manually before this
     translation will work.

 -- Function: true-truth-value? ((self TRUTH-VALUE)) : BOOLEAN
     Return TRUE if SELF represents some form of truth.

 -- Function: true? ((self PROPOSITION)) : BOOLEAN
     Return true if SELF is true (or default-true if we are considering
     default assertions).

 -- N-Command: unassert ((proposition PARSE-TREE)) : OBJECT
     Retract the truth, falsity or inconsistency of PROPOSITION.  This
     is a more general version of `retract' that also handles falsity.
     For example, if we assert the proposition "(not (sad Fred))", and
     then execute the statement "(unassert (sad Fred))", the truth
     value of the proposition "(sad Fred)" will be set to UNKNOWN.  If
     we had called `retract' in place of `unassert', the proposition
     "(sad Fred)" would remain set to FALSE.   Note that for this
     unassertion to succeed, the logic constant `Fred' and the relation
     `sad' must already be defined.

 -- Function: unassert-proposition ((self PROPOSITION)) :
     Retract the truth, falsity or inconsistency of the proposition
     SELF.

 -- Function: unknown-truth-value? ((self TRUTH-VALUE)) : BOOLEAN

     Classify all named descriptions.

 -- Function: upclassify-all-instances () :
     Classify all named instances.

 -- Function: upclassify-instances ((module MODULE) (local? BOOLEAN)) :
     Classify instances local to MODULE and inherited by MODULE.  If
     LOCAL?, don't classify inherited descriptions.  If MODULE is NULL,
     classify descriptions in all modules.

 -- Function: upclassify-named-descriptions ((module MODULE)
          (local? BOOLEAN)) :
     Classify named descriptions local to MODULE and inherited by
     MODULE.  If LOCAL?, don't classify inherited descriptions.  If
     MODULE is NULL, classify descriptions in all modules.

 -- Method on OBJECT-STORE: update-proposition-in-store (store
          (proposition PROPOSITION) (update-mode KEYWORD)) :
     A module with STORE has had the truth value of PROPOSITION change
     according to UPDATE-MODE.  The default method does nothing.

 -- Function: update-tuple ((relation SURROGATE)
          (arguments (CONS OF OBJECT)) (updatemode KEYWORD)) :
          PROPOSITION
     Assert or retract a proposition that applies RELATION to ARGUMENTS.

 -- Function: weaken-truth-value ((tv1 TRUTH-VALUE) (tv2 TRUTH-VALUE))
          : TRUTH-VALUE
     If TV2 has lesser strength than TV1, adapt the strength of TV1 (not
     its value!) and return the result.  Otherwise, return TV1
     unmodified.

 -- Macro: with-logic-environment ((moduleForm OBJECT)
          (environment OBJECT) &body (body CONS)) : OBJECT
     Execute BODY within the module resulting from MODULEFORM.
     `*module*' is an acceptable MODULEFORM.  It will locally rebind

     Execute BODY within the meta cache of the current module.  Set
     appropriate special variables.

 -- Function: create-keyword ((name STRING)) : KEYWORD
     Returns the Stella keyword NAME, creating it if necessary.  NAME
     is treated case-sensitively.  This should generally not be
     necessary to do.

 -- Function: create-symbol ((name STRING) (module MODULE)
          (environment ENVIRONMENT)) : SYMBOL
     Returns the Stella symbol NAME visible in MODULE, creating it if
     necessary.  NAME is ALWAYS treated case-sensitively, even if
     MODULE is case insensitive. This should generally not be necessary
     to do.

 -- Function: get-inconsistent-propositions ((module MODULE)
          (environment ENVIRONMENT)) : (PL-ITERATOR OF PROPOSITION)
     Return inconsistent propositions visible in MODULE.

     (or inferred by forward chaining).

 -- Function: load-in-module ((filename STRING) (module MODULE)
          (environment ENVIRONMENT)) :
     Read logic commands from the file named FILENAME and evaluate them.
     If the file does not have an `in-module' declaration that
     specifies the module within which all remaining commands are to be
     evaluated, it will be loaded in the MODULE specified.  If no
     MODULE is specified and the file does not contain an `in-module'
     declaration, an error will be signaled.  The remaining commands
     are evaluated one-by-one, applying the function `evaluate' to each
     of them.

 -- Function: load-native-stream-in-module
          ((stream NATIVE-INPUT-STREAM) (module MODULE)
          (environment ENVIRONMENT)) :
     Read logic commands from the native input stream STREAM and
     evaluate them.  Assumes STREAM is a line-buffered stream which is
     a safe compromise but does not generate the best efficiency for
     block-buffered streams such as files.  If the stream does not
     supply an `in-module' declaration that specifies the module within
     which all remaining commands are to be evaluated, it will be
     loaded in the MODULE specified.  If no MODULE is specified and the
     file does not supply an `in-module' declaration, an error will be
     signaled.  The remaining commands are evaluated one-by-one,
     applying the function `evaluate' to each of them.

 -- Function: load-stream-in-module ((stream INPUT-STREAM)
          (module MODULE) (environment ENVIRONMENT)) :
     Read logic commands from the STELLA stream STREAM and evaluate
     them.  If the stream does not supply an `in-module' declaration
     that specifies the module within which all remaining commands are
     to be evaluated, it will be loaded in the MODULE specified.  If no
     MODULE is specified and the file does not supply an `in-module'
     declaration, an error will be signaled.  The remaining commands

12 Glossary
***********

This glossary contains brief definitions for terms used in the PowerLoom
User's Manual and/or used by the knowledge representation community.  It
is impractical to give a logically precise definition for many of these
terms, because their interpretation varies quite a bit.  In this case,
the glossary attempts to indicate a range of interpretations consistent
with their use in PowerLoom.

*Assertion:* An assertion states that a particular proposition is
`True' or `False'.

*Backward and Forward Inference:* *???*

*BACKWARD RULE:* *???*

*Binary Relation:* A relation having two arguments (arity equals two),
often as a mapping from one concept domain to another.  This is by far
the most common form of relation.

*Classifier:* A classifier is a type of an inference engine that
implements efficient strategies for computing subsumption relations
between pairs of concepts, or for computing instance-of relations
between a concept an a set of instances.  PowerLoom implements a
classifier that can be explicitly invoked by an application program.

*Clipping:* If a function or single-valued binary relation maps an
instance to two or more other instances, a logical contradiction (a
clash) exists.  If clipping is enabled, PowerLoom will automatically
retract all assertions but the last that lead to a clash.  Clipping can
be toggled on or off; it is enabled by default.

*Closed-World Semantics:* Under closed-world semantics it is assumed
that "if proposition `P' cannot be proved `True', then assume that `P'
is `False'."  PowerLoom gives programmers the option to explicitly
declare that concept or a relation operates under the assumption of
closed-world semantics (See also Open-World Semantics).

*Concept:* A concept defines a category or class of individuals.
PowerLoom categorizes a concept as a special kind of relation.  The
distinction between a concept and a unary relation is subtle (some
logicians do not believe that there is any distinction(1)).  In
linguistics, the distinction is that between a noun and an adjective.
In logic, the test we favor is whether or not the relation has a domain
-- a unary relation has a domain, while a concept does not.  For
example, the relation `married' has domain `person', while the concept
`married-person' does not have a domain (or is its own domain).

*Constraint:* "Constraint" at its most general is a synonym for "rule".
Often a constraint is conceptualized as a rule that restricts the types
of the arguments that can appear within a tuple.

*Context:* *???*

*Default Rule:* A default rule expresses an conditional implication
that applies only when its consequent is consistent with current state
of the knowledge base.  In other words, the rule applies only when it
will not lead to a contradition.

*Definition:* A definition binds a name to a logical expression.
PowerLoom syntax defines several operators with names of the form
`defxxx' (e.g., `defconcept' and `defrule') that declare definitions
for various types of entities.

*Description:* A "description" is an expression that defines a
particular logical relation (e.g., the class of all three-legged black
cats).  In PowerLoom, the terms "concept" and "relation" generally
refer to `named' relations, while a description may or may not have a
name.  The KIF operators `kappa' and `setofall' are used to define
unnamed descriptions.

*Description Logic:* The term "description logic" refers to a logic
that focuses on descriptions as its principal means for expressing
logical expressions.  A description logic system emphasises the use of
classification and subsumption reasoning as its primary mode of
inference.  Loom and Classic were two early examples of knowledge
representation systems that implement description logics.

*Domain Model:* A collection of definitions, rules, and facts that
characterizes the possible states of some real or imagined world.  The
domain model specifies a terminology (of concepts and relations) that
is useful for describing objects in that world.  Often "domain model"
refers to that portion of a world's representation that does not change
over time.

*Extension:* Given a relation `R' with arity `N', the extension of `R'
is the set of ground propositions of the form `(R x1 ... xN)' whose
truth value is true.  If R is a concept, then its extension of often
considered to be, not a set of unary tuples, but the set of argument
fillers of those tuples, i.e., the set of instances that belong to the
concept.

*Fact:* A fact is a proposition that has been asserted to be either
`True' or `False'.  The term "fact" usually refers to a "ground
proposition", i.e., a proposition that can be represented as a
predicate applied to a sequence of instances or literals.

*Filler:* The second argument to a binary tuple is often refered to as
its "filler".  When a multiple-valued binary relation maps an instance
to a set of values, these values are also called "fillers".

*Forward Rule:* *???*

*Function:* Formally, a function is a relation such that the   value of
the last (nth) argument of a relational tuple is a function of the
values of the first n-1 arguments.  This definition coincides with the
notion of a "single-valued relation".  PowerLoom (and KIF) support
specialized syntax that allows functions that have been defined using
the operator `deffunction' to appear in term expressions (e.g., `(= (f
?x) 42))').

*Instance:* An instance denotes an entity within a domain model, a
member of the concept _Thing_.  Depending on ones interpretation, this
could include almost everything.  Often the term "instance" is used
more narrowly, to exclude literals and other objects whose properties
do not change over time.  PowerLoom assumes that concepts and relations
are instances.

*KIF:* Short for "Knowledge Interchange Format",  KIF is a language
that defines a Lisp-like syntax for the predicate calculus.  There is
an ANSII-standard that defines the KIF syntax and semantics.  PowerLoom
adopts KIF as its representation language, and adds a few extensions.

*Knowledge Base:* A knowledge base attempts to capture in abstract
(machine interpretable) form a useful representation of a physical or
virtual world. The entities in that world are modeled in the knowledge
base by objects we call _ terms_. Examples of terms are "Georgia"
(denoting the U.S., state), "BenjaminFranklin" (denoting the historical
person by that name), the number three, the string "abc", and the
concept "Person".

*Literal:* A logically static constant.  Examples are numbers, strings,
quantities, and truth values.

*Module:* *???*

*Open-World Semantics:* PowerLoom assumes an open-world semantics,
unless a user explicitly specifies that it use closed-world semantics.
Under this assumption, if PowerLoom cannot prove or disprove a
proposition, then it assigns that proposition the value `Unknown' (See
also Closed-World Semantics).

*Predicate:*.  The term _predicate_ is a syntactic notion that refers
to the zeroth arguments of a proposition.  Predicates denote relations
and properties, i.e., sets.

*Proposition:*.  A logical sentence whose truth value can be evaluated
with respect to some context.  Each PowerLoom assertion assigns the
value `True' or `False' to some proposition.

*Primitive Relation:* `P' is a primitive concept or relation if and
only if a proof that `(P x1 ... xn)' is true exists only for the case
that there exists an explicit assertion of a proposition `(Q x1 ...
xn)' and either `Q' equals `P' or `Q' is a proper subrelation of `P'.
In otherwords, the only rules that imply membership in `P' are those
that relate `P' to one of its (proper) subconcepts or subrelations.

*Query:* A query probes the informational state of a knowledge base.
An `ask' query test the truth of its propositional argument.  A
`retrieve' asks for sets of constants (bindings) that make its
propositional argument true when the constants are substituted in place
of its variables.  The propositional argument to `ask' and `retrieve'
arbitrary expression in the first-order predicate calculus.  Because of
constraints imposed either by resource limitations or inherent
undecidability, PowerLoom cannot guarantee the completeness of its
inferences.

*Relation:* *???*

*Retraction:* A retraction changes the truth value of a proposition
from either `True' or `False' to the value `Unknown'.  Retraction is a
procedural (non-declarative) operation.

*Rule:* A "rule" is any universally-quantified proposition, i.e., a
proposition of the form `(forall (?x1 ... ?xn) <logical sentence with
free variables ?x1 ... ?xn)'.  PowerLoom supports several different
syntactic constructs for defining rules.  (See also Forward Rule and
Backward Rule).

*Subsumption:* A subsumption relation specifies the relative generality
of two concepts.  A concept `A' subsumes a concept `B' if the
definitions of `A' and `B' logically imply that members of `B' must
also be members of `A'.

*Truth-Maintenance:* *???*

*Type:* Often used a synonym for the term _concept_.  The phrase "a
type of an instance" generally refers to (one of) the concepts that the
instance belongs to.  The phrase "nth domain type" refers to a concept
that contains all instances of the nth column of a relation.

*World:* *???*

13 PowerLoom Grammar
********************

The syntax of PowerLoom is described below using a modified BNF notation
adapted from the KIF specification.

* Menu:

* Alphabet::
* Grammar::


File: manual.info,  Node: Alphabet,  Next: Grammar,  Prev: PowerLoom Grammar,  Up: PowerLoom Grammar

13.1 Alphabet
=============

We distinguish between terminals, which are part of the language, and
nonterminals. All nonterminals are bracketed as follows
`<nonterminal>'. Squared brackets means zero or one instances of the
enclosed expression; `<nonterminal>*' means zero or more occurrences
and `<nonterminal>+' means one or more occurrences of `<nonterminal>'.
The notation `<nonterminal1> - <nonterminal2>' refers to all of the
members of `<nonterminal1>' except for those in `<nonterminal2>'.

   A word is a contiguous sequence of characters, which include all
upper case letters, lower case letters, digits and alpha characters
(ASCII character set from 93 to 128) excluding some special characters
like white spaces, single and double quotes and brackets.

   `<word> ::=' A PRIMITIVE SYNTACTIC OBJECT

   Special words are those who refer to a variable. All variables are
preceded by a question mark.

   `<indvar> ::=' A WORD BEGINNING WITH THE CHARACTER `?'

   A string `<string>' is a character sequence including words plus all
special charcters (except double quotes) enclosed in double quotes.  A
double quote can be included in a string if it is preceeded by the
escape character '`\''.

13.2 Grammar
============

Legal expressions in PowerLoom are forms, which are either a statement
or a definition, described in more detail below.

   `<form> ::= <statement> | <definition>'

13.2.1 Constants and Typed Variables
------------------------------------

The language consists of several groups of operators, defined as
follows:

   `<termop> ::= listof | setof | the | setofall | kappa'

   ` <sentop> ::= = | /= | not | fail | and | or | forall | exists
| <= | => | <=> |<<= | =>> | <~ | ~> | <<~ | ~>> '

   ` <defop> ::= defconcept | deffunction | defrelation | defrule |
:documentation | :-> |
:<= | :=> | :<<= | :=>> |
:<=> | :<=>> :<<=> | :<<=>> | := |
:axioms '

   `<operator> ::= <termop> | <sentop> | <defop>'

   All other words are constants (words which are not operators or
variables):

   `<constant> ::= <word> - <indvar> - <operator>'

   Semantically, there are different categories of constants --
_Concept_ constants `<conceptconst>', _Function_ constants
`<funconst>', _Relation_ constants `<relconst>', _Rule_ constants
`<ruleconst>' and _Logical_ constants `<logconst>'. The differences
between these categories are entirely semantic. However, some operators
will only accept specific constants.

   In contrast to the specification of KIF3.0, PowerLoom supports a
typed syntax. Therefore, variables in quantified terms and sentences
can appear either typed or untyped, as follows:

13.2.2 Terms
------------

Terms are used to denote objects in the world being described:

   ` <term> ::= <indvar> | <constant> | <funterm> | <listterm> |
<setterm> |
<quanterm>'

   `<listterm> ::= (listof <term>*)'

   `<setterm> ::= (setof <term>*)'

   `<funterm> ::= (<funconst> <term>+)'

   Note: Zero arguments are allowed for `<funterm>' in KIF3.0: `<term>*'

   ` <quanterm> ::= (the <vardecl> <sentence>) |
(setofall <vardecl> <sentence>) |
(kappa {<vardecl> | (<vardecl>+)} <sentence>) |
(lambda {<vardecl> | (<vardecl>+)} <term>) '

   Note: KIF3.0 allows `<term>' instead of `<vardecl>' for `setofall'.
No `<quanterm>' as well as no `<setterm>' in core of KIF as a result of
descision 95-3 (March 1995).

13.2.3 Sentences
----------------

Sentences are used to express propositions about the world:

   ` <sentence> ::= <constant> | <equation> | <inequality> |
<relsent> | <logsent> | <quantsent> '

   `<equation> ::= (= <term> <term>)'

   `<inequality> ::= (/= <term> <term>)'

   `<relsent> ::= (<constant> <term>+)'

   Note: Zero arguments allowed in KIF3.0 for `<relsent>' (`<term>*').
`<funconst>' is currently not allowed in PowerLoom (use `(= <funterm>
<term>)' instead).

   ` <logsent> ::= (not <sentence>) |
(fail <sentence>) |
(and <sentence>*) |
(or <sentence>*) |
(=> <sentence>* <sentence>) | (=>> <sentence>* <sentence>) |
(<= <sentence> <sentence>*) | (<<= <sentence> <sentence>*) |
(~> <sentence>* <sentence>) | (~>> <sentence>* <sentence>) |
(<~ <sentence> <sentence>*) | (<<~ <sentence> <sentence>*) '

   ` <quantsent> ::= (forall {<vardecl> | (<vardecl>+)} <sentence>) |
(forall {<vardecl> | (<vardecl>+)} <sentence> <sentence>) |
(exists {<vardecl> | (<vardecl>+)} <sentence>) '

13.2.4 Definitions
------------------

PowerLoom supports two distinct categories of definitions -- relation
definitions (including concept and function definitions) and rule
definitions.  A relation definition introduces a new logical constant,
and states some facts about that constant (e.g., who its parents are in
a subsumption taxonomy).  A rule definitions binds a new constant to a
proposition (so that the constant _denotes_ the proposition) and
asserts the truth of that proposition.  Usually, the proposition
asserted by a `defrule' is an implication.  The assertional truth of a
proposition defined by a rule can be altered by asserting or retracting
the constant that denotes the proposition.
