;;;    A VALUE, THE PRIMARY TYPE OF THE NEW VALUE MUST SPECIALIZE THE PRIMARY

;;; Evaluation of surrogates
;;;    Surrogates are evaluated differently depending on *evaluationMode*:
;;;   EXTENSIONAL:
;;;    The current value of the surrogate is returned.
;;;    The value of the surrogate must be defined at evaluation time --
;;;    if the surrogate is undefined, an instance is allocated on-the-fly,
;;;    and the surrogate is bound to it.
;;;   DESCRIPTION and QUERY:
;;;    The surrogate is returned unevaluated (except when they point to literals.
;;;    This has the beneficial effect of preventing the creating of backlinks
;;;    from external objects back into a description.
;;;   INTENSIONAL:
;;;    In this case we want ALL references (across all descriptions
;;;    and assertions) to refer to the same intensional object
;;;    regardless of the surrogate's binding.  We accomplish this by
;;;    inserting an intensional skolem between the surrogate and the
;;;    (extensional) skolem that it is bound to.

;;; Note on surrogate bindings:
;;;  The type of a surrogate is determined by the object that it points to.
;;;  If a different value is assigned to a surrogate, that value must have the
;;;     same primary type as its predecessor.
;;;  If we need to compute the type of a surrogate 'self', then it's an error
;;;     if '(value-of self)' is not defined.

;;;;;; Constructing propositions from source trees
  ;;

;;; To detect duplicates of complex propositions (which might differ in
;;; argument order, variable names, etc.) we now store propositions and
;;; descriptions in a structured object index that indexes them based
;;; on a structure hash code.  In fact, we now store all propositions
;;; (not just complex ones) in this table, since it improves lookup times
;;; for cases where we have large numbers of backlinks and
;;; `find-similar-proposition' can take a long time.

;;; Issues/TO DO:
;;; - The structured object index could be stored on a per-module basis
;;;   and completely replace `locally-conceived-propositions' and `-terms'.
;;;   We would have to run up the hierarchy in some cases (e.g., if no
;;;   local relations or constants are referenced), but we would get better
;;;   module-local behavior with clearing, etc.  This would also mirror
;;;   better what we do for persistent storage and could aid lookup there as well.
;;; - eliminate use of `find-similar-proposition' in inherit-description and friends
;;;   once we are convinced that it doesn't buy us much anymore
;;; - with function propositions, we now don't evaluate terms when hashing to
;;;   find duplicates, which has some implications for equality reasoning.
;;; - when we load without checking duplicates, nothing is added to the index

;;; Hashing issues:

;;;   due to the commutativity of XOR (despite some rotation)
;;; - similar for (OR (R A B) (S C D)) (OR (R C D) (S A B))
;;; - we currently map all variables onto the same code which

;;;     - we don't handle retraction right since it is not done in an inference cache
;;;     - we don't handle truth values right: both (r a b) and (not (r a b)) assert
;;;       missing types about a and b
;;;     - if (r a b) only holds by default, types should also only hold by default
;;;       which is what it would be if it were implemented by a rule
;;;     - if we actually infer (r a b), we don't get the additional type inferences
;;;       for a and b
;;;   - if we want both, i.e., allow it to be an inference or a constraint, we should
;;;     invent a separate syntax for the constraint case which then could also be
;;;     used more reliably during inference and rule application (right now that is
;;;     also somewhat of a mess).  For example:
;;;       (defrelation r ((?x => c) (?y => d)))       ...vs.
;;;       (defrelation r ((?x <= c) (?y <= d)))       ...where by default
;;;       (defrelation r ((?x c) (?y d)))             ...means infer the types
;;;       (defrelation r ((?x => c) (?y d) (?z <= e)) ...mixed use is ok
