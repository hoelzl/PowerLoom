Update of /nfs/image2/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/logic
In directory redhouse:/home/hans/Projects/powerloom/sources/logic

Modified Files:
	propositions.ste 
Log Message:
TRUTH-VALUE:
  Added `polarity' and `strength' slots so predicates like `true?'
  can be more informed when called with truth values that are
  different than the standard truth value constants (this is not used
  yet but might be once we attach justifications).

assign-truth-value:
  Handle new INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE.  Once a proposition is
  inconsistent, it cannot be assigned any other truth value until it has
  been explicitly retracted via `deassign-truth-value'.
  Fix handling of built-in proposition constants, so we can't
  accidentally assing a truth value to them (e.g., via (assert (or))).

deassign-truth-value:
  Handle new :RETRACT-INCONSISTENT update mode.

TRUE-TRUTH-VALUE TRUTH-VALUE, FALSE-TRUTH-VALUE,
DEFAULT-TRUE-TRUTH-VALUE, DEFAULT-FALSE-TRUTH-VALUE,
UNKNOWN-TRUTH-VALUE:
  Initialize new `polarity' and `strength' slots.
  Folded in initialization of `positive-score' (not sure anymore why
  this was done in separate startup code before).

INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE:
  New truth value to flag inconsistent propositions.

true?, false?:
  Fixed handling of non-standard truth-values.  Before that was
  strictly done based on `positive-score' which caused problems with the
  new INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE (and is simply wrong anyway).

unknown?:
  Now subsumes `inconsistent?'.

inconsistent?, inconsistent-truth-value?:
  New predicates.

conjoin-truth-values, invert-truth-value, print-truth-value:
  Handle new INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE.

signal-truth-value-clash:
  Now assigns the INCONSISTENT-TRUTH-VALUE to avoid any further
  propagation from it.

unbind-skolem-value:
  Fixed: break the skolem-value link before we look for the equating
  proposition, otherwise we might pick the wrong one from a function
  proposition that has the same value.  Fixes retraction problem of function
  propositions that share their value with others.

find-equating-proposition:
  Streamlined the search for a backlinked object, since the search
  loop would never execute anyway.  What the loop was trying to
  achieve was to find the innermost skolem that points to the non-logic
  object, but the way it was written that would never occur.
  Rethink this, not sure this is really needed.

check-type?:
  Robustfied by checking for a NULL object.

unassert:
  Fixed, generalized: now returns the list of affected propositions
  just like `retract' and does the right thing for function propositions.
  Now also lets one unassert inconsistent propositions.

unassert-proposition:
  Renamed from `unassert-fact'.
  Now properly handles function propositions and inconsistent
  propositions.

Modified Files:
	specialists.ste 
Log Message:
MEMBER-OF-evaluator:
  Fixed: make sure the evaluated proposition is actually true.
  Improved: now checks membership assertions to an enumerated set to
  make sure the assertion is not contradictory.  If it is, it signals a
  clash.  For example, the following proposition now causes a clash:

        (member-of pink (setof red green blue))

  This fixes a bug with missing clashes for assertions to concepts
  that were defined via explicit enumeration.

initialize:

load-stream, load-native-stream:
  New functions.

ask, retrieve:
  Improved documentation.

s-ask, s-retrieve:
  Improved documentation.
  Fixed: make sure we read the arguments in the proper module.
  Eliminated DWIM-ing of extra level of parentheses.  Now we expect
  all arguments to be at the top level, i.e., without a surrounding set
  of parentheses.  This is since we can't really reliably intuit
  whether to drop them or not without doing some more extensive
  parsing (especially true for `s-retrieve').  One way to look at this
  is that for the `s-...' versions the string quotes play the role of
  the surrounding parentheses.
