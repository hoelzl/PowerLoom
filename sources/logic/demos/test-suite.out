:KIF

|= (HELP ASSERT)

ASSERT ((proposition OBJECT)):
  Assert the truth of `proposition'.  Return the asserted proposition object.
  KIF example:  "(assert (happy Fred))" asserts that Fred is indeed happy.
  Note that for this assertion to succeed, the relation `happy' must already
  be defined.  If the constant `Fred' has not yet been created, it is
  automatically created as a side-effect of calling `assert'.
