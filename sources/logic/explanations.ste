;;; Version: explanations.ste,v 1.14 2010/12/07 01:20:25 tar Exp

;;; Support for generating explanations

(in-package "STELLA")

(in-module "LOGIC")


;;; TO DO:

;;; - Handle :DISJUNCTIVE-IMPLICATION-INTRODUCTION
;;; - Handle :ITERATIVE-FORALL
;;; - Handle subset queries that use :CONTAINED-BY, subsumption, or
;;;   simple computation.
;;; - Annotate named rules
;;; - Explain normalization transformations
;;; - Handle reference to a defined class for member/isa propositions that are
;;;   derived from a `setof' definition of a class (e.g., COLOR).
;;; - Make intensional function propositions like
;;;   (= (FRIENDS BUCK) (FRIENDS BUCK)) invisible.
;;; - `append' demo looks a bit funny (maybe related to intensional function
;;;   propositions).
;;; - Handle funniness introduced by function denesting, e.g., the resulting
;;;   `and' in the example below looks weird:
;;;       (and (= (AGE FRED) (AGE FRED))
;;;            (> (AGE FRED) 30))
;;; - Handle subsumption relationships that look like primitive assertions, e.g.,
;;;   in recursion demo, `has-ancestor' subsumes `has-parent', hence, the
;;;   explicit `has-parent' assertions are always recorded as `has-ancestor'
;;;   assertions.

;;; Tom's suggestions:

;;; - Mention rule in modus ponens as last antecedent.
;;; - Use forward-implication by default.

;;; Done.
;;; - Handle propositions derived via forward inference.
;;;

  "Print an explanation for the result of the most recent query.
Without any arguments, `why' prints an explanation of the top level
query proposition down to a maximum depth of 3.  `(why all)' prints
an explanation to unlimited depth.  Alternatively, a particular depth
can be specified, for example, `(why 5)' explains down to a depth of 5.
A proof step that was not explained explicitly (e.g., due to a depth
cutoff) can be explained by supplying the label of the step as the
first argument to `why', for example, `(why 1.2.3 5)' prints an explanation
starting at 1.2.3 down to a depth of 5 (which is counted relative to the
depth of the starting point).  The keywords `brief' and `verbose' can be
used to select a particular explanation style.  In brief mode, explicitly
asserted propositions are not further explained and indicated with a
`!' assertion marker.  Additionally, relatively uninteresting proof steps
such as AND-introductions are skipped.  This explanation style option is
sticky and will affect future calls to `why' until it gets changed again.
The various options can be combined in any way, for example,
`(why 1.2.3 brief 3)' explains starting from step 1.2.3 down to a depth
of 3 in brief explanation mode."
