  "Enable the PowerLoom environment feature(s) named by `features'.
Return the list of enabled features.  Calling `set-feature' without any
arguments can be used to display the currently enabled features.
The following features are supported:

`just-in-time-inference': Enables interleaving of forward chaining inference
within backward chaining queries.

`iterative-deepening': Tells the query processor to use iterative deepening
instead of a depth-first search to find answers.  This is less efficient
but necessary for some kinds of highly recursive queries.

`trace-subgoals': Enables the generation of subgoaling trace information during
backchaining inference.

`trace-solutions': Prints newly found solutions during retrieval right when they
are generated as opposed to when the query terminates.

`trace-classifier': Tells the classifier to describe the inferences it draws.

`justifications': Enables the generation of justifications during inference,
which is a prerequiste for the generation of explanations with `(why)'.

`emit-thinking-dots': Tells PowerLoom to annotate its inference progress by
outputting characters indicating the completion of individual reasoning steps.

By default, the features `emit-thinking-dots' and `just-in-time-inference'
are enabled, and the others are disabled.

;;; Mapping names onto objects:

;;; The routines below handle how symbols in logic parse trees get
;;; mapped onto the proper logic objects named by those symbols.  The general
;;; problem is to map a symbol whose module is SM onto a logic object surrogate
;;; whose module is OM all relative to the current module M.  The surrogates
;;; are then pointing at the actual logic objects, however, due to forward
;;; references an object surrogate might not yet be pointing at an object.
;;; The mapping mechanism is complicated and kludgy for a variety of reasons:
;;; (1) parallel symbol/surrogate spaces: the internal names used by logic
;;;     objects are surrogates but external names typed by users are symbols.
;;;     Symbols and surrogates need to be kept in sync for proper connection
;;;     between internal and external names.
;;; (2) disappearing explicit qualification: once the STELLA reader has
;;;     read an expression, we don't know anymore which of the read symbols
;;;     was explicitly qualified.  The only symbols for which we can reliably
;;;     make this determination are those not visible from the current module.
;;;     This is really a bug, but fixing it requires an extensive change to
;;;     all logic input routines, so we postpone that for now.
;;; (3) forward references: if we read a name of an as yet undefined object
;;;     we need to allocate a surrogate and object for it so that we can
;;;     build appropriate data structures.  But where should that be allocated
;;;     if the module of the name used is not the same as the current module?
;;; (4) symbol pollution: modules such as PL-KERNEL use code modules such as
;;;     LOGIC or STELLA that make available a large set of symbols that
;;;     are picked up by the reader when used as logic terms, but which often
;;;     don't have corresponding logic definitions (leads to problem (3)).

;;; Access/lookup rules:
;;;
;;; unqualified symbol:
;;; - case 1: SM = M (i.e., symbol module = current module)
;;;   - case 1.1: a bound object surrogate with module OM already exists
;;;          and OM = SM.  This is the easiest case, we simply pick up that
;;;          surrogate with its associated object.
;;;   - case 1.2: a bound object surrogate with module OM already exists,
;;;          OM is a parent of SM and there is no local surrogate in M.
;;;          This is an unusual case, since the unqualified symbol must have
;;;          been read before the object was defined.  Otherwise, the reader
;;;          would have picked up the symbol from module OM.  Anyway, we pick
;;;          up the surrogate with module OM.
;;;   - case 1.3: an unbound object surrogate with module OM already exists.
;;;          Regardless of whether OM = M or a parent of M, we generate a
;;;          local bound surrogate.
;;;   - case 1.4: no object surrogate exists in either M or any of its parents.
;;;          We generate a local bound surrogate.
;;; - case 2: SM is a parent of M
;;;   - case 2.1: just like case 1.1.
;;;   - case 2.2: just like case 1.2.
;;;   - case 2.3: just like case 1.3.
;;;   - case 2.3: just like case 1.4.

;;; qualified symbol (note, that we can only determine those for modules
;;; that are not visible from the current module M - for now):
;;; - case 3: SM not visible from M:
;;;   - case 3.1: just like case 1.1.
;;;   - case 3.2: an unbound object surrogate with module OM already exists.
;;;          Regardless of whether OM = SM or a parent of SM, we generate a
;;;          local bound surrogate in SM whose value/object will have home
;;;          module M.
;;;   - case 3.3: no object surrogate exists in either SM or any of its parents.
;;;          We generate a local bound surrogate in SM whose value/object will
;;;          have home module M.

;;;;;; Finalization of defined objects
  ;;

;;; Definition of objects such as concepts, relations, instances or
;;; propositions (rules) happens in two steps: (1) creation of an
;;; appropriate logic object or proposition and its association with a
;;; name, and (2) assertion of various axioms related to the new
;;; object.  Finalization asserts the axiom propositions that were
;;; collected during an object's definition step and stored in its
;;; `axioms' slot (more used to happen during finalization of
;;; descriptions, but most of that has become unnecessary).  In
;;; principle, all the axioms could be asserted immediately during the
;;; definition step, but there are a couple of advantages of keeping the
;;; 2-phase mechanism.  (1) it allows us to better handle some forward
;;; reference problems by first creating all objects such as concepts
;;; and relations and then asserting propositions that reference them,
;;; and (2) it gives us a better way of accessing the propositions
;;; associated with the definition of an object for purposes of
;;; loading them into a persistent store.
