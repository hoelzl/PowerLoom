<H1 CLASS="western">GUI Overview</H1>
<P>The PowerLoom&reg; GUI is shown in Figure 1.  The main application
frame consists of pull-down menus, a toolbar, and a status bar.<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif"><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym" SDFIXED><SUP> </SUP></A></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN ID="Frame1" STYLE="float: left; width: 17.73cm; height: 14.22cm; border: none; padding: 0cm; background: #ffffff">
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm"><IMG SRC="./Powerloom GUI User's Guide_html_m3cc50226.gif" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=100% BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Figure
	1  The PowerLoom GUI</I></FONT></P>
</SPAN>The application has the following menus: KB, Edit, Objects,
Query, View, and Navigate.  These menus are described as follows:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>KB -</B> The KB menu contains menu items for connecting to
	a server, loading, saving, and clearing KBs,  and opening browser
	and console windows.  
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Edit -</B> The Edit menu contains items for cutting,
	copying, pasting, and deleting, and also contains an item which
	opens a preferences dialog.  
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Objects </B>- The Objects menu contains items for opening
	editors on various KB objects, including modules, concepts,
	relations, instances, and propositions.   This menu also contains an
	item to edit the currently-selected object.  
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Query -</B> The Query menu contains items for querying the
	KB, searching the KB, and editing a relation's extension.  
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>View -</B> The View menu contains various items for
	updating the appearance of the application, including a refresh item
	to bring the GUI up-to-date with the state of the KB on the server,
	and menu items for showing/hiding the application's toolbar and
	status bar.  This menu also contains items for changing the
	application's font &ndash; the demo theme changes all fonts to a
	large bold font suitable for demo presentations.  
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Navigate -</B> The Navigate menu contains items for
	navigating backward and forward in a browser's selection history.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Window - </B> The Window menu contains a list of the
	currently open windows on the desktop. Selecting a window brings the
	window to the top of the window stack, and if the window is
	iconified, it is de-iconified.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Help &ndash;</B> The help menu contains an item to open an
	HTML help browser, and an item to open an About box which contains
	information about the PowerLoom GUI.</P>
</UL>
<P>Most menu items have accelerator keys which allows an item to be
executed by a combination of keystrokes.  The detailed operation of
each of the menu items will be elaborated further in the GUI Features
section.</P>
<P>The toolbar contains several buttons which provide shortcuts to
menu items.  There are currently toolbar buttons for cutting,
copying, pasting, deleting, editing an object, and opening a query
dialog.  The toolbar may be undocked from its default position by
dragging it anywhere on the desktop.  It may also be hidden by
selecting the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">View -&gt; Hide</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">Toolbar</FONT> menu item.</P>
<P>The status bar at the bottom of the application contains
information on the current status of the application.  The status bar
is divided into two sections.  The leftmost section displays the last
module that was selected by a user.  The application keeps track of
the current module in order to provide continuity between operations.
 For example, if a user opens a browser and browses the AIRCRAFT-KB,
and then opens a query dialog, it makes sense for the query dialog to
use the AIRCRAFT-KB module instead of some other module.  
</P>
<P>The rightmost section of the status bar contains messages that
pertain to the current state of the application.  For example, if a
user selects a concept and then clicks the cut toolbar button, a
message will appear in the rightmost status bar prompting the user to
select another concept and perform a paste action.  The status bar
may be hidden by selecting the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">View
-&gt; Hide Status Bar</FONT> menu item.</P>
<P>Figure 1 shows a few internal frames that are open.  The function
of each frame is identified in the frame's title bar, and each type
of frame has a unique icon in it's upper lefthand corner.  In this
example, the three open frames are used to browse the KB, query the
KB, and edit an instance, respectively.</P>
<P>A user typically follows a workflow cycle similar to the following
sequence:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>The user launches the GUI by clicking on a hyperlink,
	executing a shell command, or clicking on a desktop icon.</P>
	<LI><P>The GUI is loaded on the user's machine.  If the GUI was
	launched via JWS, JWS may need to download the entire application or
	updates to the application before execution begins.  
	</P>
	<LI><P>The GUI reads a preferences file stored in a default location
	on the user's local machine.  If this is the first time the
	application is being executed, a default preferences file is used.  
	 The preferences file includes  among other things the PowerLoom
	server that was last accessed.</P>
	<LI><P>If the preferences file contains the last-accessed server, it
	attempts to connect to the server and query the server for a
	description of the server's capabilities.  If connection is
	successful, a browser window will open displaying the modules that
	are currently loaded in the server instance.</P>
	<LI><P>The user selects any KB files (s)he wishes to load, and
	instructs the server to load the file.</P>
	<LI><P>The user performs some browsing, querying, and editing of the
	loaded KB.</P>
	<LI><P>If any changes were made, the user saves the KB.</P>
	<LI><P>The user repeats steps 5-7 as needed, and then exits the
	application.</P>
</OL>
<H1 CLASS="western">GUI Features</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This section provides a detailed
description of the features that are available in the GUI
application.  We describe general application-wide functionality as
well as the functionality of specific components.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Connect to Server</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The first time the GUI is started, it
will not attempt to connect to any server.  To establish a server
connection, the user must select the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">KB
-&gt; Connect to Server </FONT>menu item.  This will open a dialog
prompting for a host name and port.  After the user enters this
information, a connection will be attempted.  If the connection is
successful, the server information will be stored in the preferences
file and used next time the application starts up.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Edit Preferences</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A preferences dialog can be opened by
selecting the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">Edit -&gt; Edit
Preferences </FONT>menu item.  Currently, the only preference that a
user can edit is whether or not open a browser when the application
is started.  The dialog contains a checkbox asking whether or not the
preferences should be saved.  If the checkbox is not checked, the
preferences will remain in effect for the duration of the current
session, but will not be in effect when the application is restarted.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">KB Load/Save</H2>
<P>PowerLoom persists knowledge bases via flat files.  The GUI has
two options for loading and saving KB files.  The first option is to
load/save files using the local file system, i.e., the file system
that is immediately accessible to the user.  This option only works
if the PowerLoom server has access to the same file system as the
user.  For example, this might be true if the server was executing on
the same LAN as the user's machine.  The second option is to
load/save files using the file system that is visible to the
PowerLoom server.  This option would be used in situtations where the
user is executing the client on a machine that is not immediately
accessible to the server, e.g., over the internet.  Since there are
significant security risks with this option, this option is disabled
by default.  It can be enabled by setting a flag on the server
indicating that remote file browsing is permissible.  In order for
this feature to be usable in practice, we would have to singificantly
enhance the security capabilities of the PowerLoom server and the
GUI.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Browsing</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Overview</H3>
<P>The knowledge browser window, shown in Figure 2, can be opened by
the selecting <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">KB -&gt; Browse </FONT>menu
item or typing <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">CTRL-B</FONT>.  The
browser provides a visual overview of all knowledge in the KB, and is
capable of launching specialized tools such as editors, search
dialogs, etc.</P>
<P><SPAN ID="Frame2" STYLE="float: left; width: 17.73cm; height: 12.65cm; border: none; padding: 0cm; background: #ffffff">
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm"><IMG SRC="./Powerloom GUI User's Guide_html_m19d5e4a.gif" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=100% BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Figure
	2  Knowledge Browser</I></FONT></P>
</SPAN>The browser consists of several subpanes which we refer to as
navigation panes.  Each navigation pane consists of a title pane, a
toolbar, and a content pane.  The title pane contains a title
indicating what is displayed in the content pane.   The toolbar
consists of zero or more buttons which perform actions relevant to
the navigation pane.  Currently, two toolbar buttons are present: Add
and Search.  Add adds an object associated with the type of
navigation pane, and Search searches for objects associated with the
type of navigation pane.  The content pane contains the actual
knowledge to be displayed, such as a list of instances or
propositions.
</P>
<P>There is one navigation pane for each type of KB object: Modules,
Concepts, Relations, Instances, Rules, and Propositions.  Each
internal pane is resiziable by dragging the movable divider between
the panes.  Panes may be hidden completely by clicking the &ldquo;collapse&rdquo;
arrow on the adjacent divider.  Clicking the &ldquo;expand&rdquo;
arrow will unhide the pane.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Viewing</H3>
<P>Navigation panes employ several visual cues to enhance the
identifiability of object attributes.  Object types are indicated by
an icon to the left of the object's name.  For example, modules are
represented by a blue M, concepts by a red C, etc.  The status of
propositions is also indicated visually.  An Italicized proposition
indicates that the proposition was derived instead of asserted.  Grey
propositions indicate that their truth value is a default value
instead of a strict value.</P>
<P>The main method for filling the contents of a navigation pane is
to select some object in a navigation pane that is to the left or
above it.  This is discussed in more detail in the Selection section
below.  However, in some cases, it is possible to modify the contents
of a navigation pane without performing a selection.  For example, in
the instance navigation pane, it is possible to show derived or
inherited instances by right-clicking on the instance list and
selecting an appropriate menu item.  Similarly, the relation
navigation pane can toggle between direct or inherited relations. 
Propositions and rules are by default displayed according to the
module that is currently selected.  However, the contents of the
proposition or rule navigation pane can be updated by selecting a
more specific module in the View From Module combobox contained in
the navigation pane's title bar.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Selection</H3>
<P>When the browser is initially opened, a tree of modules is
displayed in the module navigation pane, and all other navigation
panes are empty.  When a module is selected, the remaining subpanes
are populated with knowledge that is contained in that module. 
Similarly, selecting a concept in the concept navigation pane
populates the relation, proposition, and instance panes with
knowledge that is relevant to the selected concept.  In general,
selecting an object in a given navigation pane may affect the
contents of navigation panes to the right and/or below it.  More
specifically, the rules for object selection are as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Selecting a module populates the concept, relation, and
	instance subpanes with knowledge contained in the module.</P>
	<LI><P>Selecting a concept populates the relation subpane with
	relations that use the concept as a domain type, and populates the
	instance subpane with the concept's extension.  The proposition and
	rule subpanes are populated with propositions and rules associated
	with the concept.</P>
	<LI><P>Selecting a relation populates the proposition and rule
	subpanes with propositions and rules associated with the relation.</P>
	<LI><P>Selecting an instance with no selected relation populates the
	proposition subpane with propositions that refer to the selected
	instance.</P>
	<LI><P>Selecting an instance and a relation populates the
	proposition subpane with propositions that contain the relation as a
	predicate, and the instance as an argument.</P>
	<LI><P>De-selecting an object will update the state of the browser
	appropriately.  For example, after selecting a module and a concept,
	deselecting the concept will refresh the concept, relation,
	instance, proposition and rule subpanes to display the knowledge
	contained in the selected module.</P>
</UL>
<P>The title pane in each navigation pane displays a description of
the source of the subpane's contents.  For example, if relation the
relation WINGSPAN was selected, and the instance AGM-130 was
selected, the proposition subpane would contain the title
&ldquo;Propositions for WINGSPAN and AGM-130&rdquo;.</P>
<P>Each selection event is recorded in a selection history which can
be rolled back and forward.  For example, assume user selects the
AIRCRAFT-KB module and then selects the GUIDANCE-TYPE concept.  If
the user then selects the Navigate -&gt; Back menu item, the
selection history will be rolled back so that only AIRCRAFT-KB is
selected.  If the user then selects <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">Navigate
-&gt; Forward</FONT>, the selection history will be rolled forward to
its original state so that both AIRCRAFT-KB and GUIDANCE-TYPE are
selected.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Navigation</H3>
<P>Knowledge can be explored by expanding and collapsing nodes in
hierarchical navigation panes such as the concept and module
navigation panes.  If a tree or list is not fully visible, the user
may use the scrollbar on the navigation pane's righthand side to
scroll through the contents of the pane.  Detailed views of objects
such as concepts and relations can be obtained by right-clicking the
object and selecting the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">Edit </FONT>menu
item.  To navigate to the constituent of a proposition, the user can
right-click the constituent and then select the Navigate to... menu
item.  For example, right-clicking on the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">GUIDANCE</FONT>
argument in the proposition <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">(NTH-DOMAIN
GUIDANCE 1 GUIDANCE-TYPE)</FONT> presents a popup menu which displays
(among other items) the item <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">Navigate
to GUIDANCE</FONT>.  Selecting this menu item will cause the browser
to display and select the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">GUIDANCE</FONT>
relation.</P>
<P>Actions external to the browser may also update the browser's
contents.  For example, clicking on an instance in a list of query
results will cause the browser to navigate to the selected instance.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Actions</H3>
<P>Right-clicking inside the browser will present a menu of actions
that is relevant to the subpane that contains the mouse pointer.  The
list of items will depend on whether the mouse is over a specific
item or if it is over the background of the subpane's list or tree. 
For example, when the mouse is over a specific concept, the menu will
contain items for cutting, pasting, instantiating, etc., but when the
mouse is over the background of the concept's tree, the only menu
item presented will be to add a new concept.</P>
<P>The set of actions for each subpane that is available for each
subpane is as follows:</P>
<UL>

</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Editing/Viewing</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Overview</H3>
<P>Objects may be edited by right-clicking the object and selecting
the Edit item menu item in the popup menu.  Alternatively, an object
may be selected, and then the Objects -&gt; Edit Object menu item can
be selected, or the edit toolbar button can be pressed.  Object
editors do double-duty as object viewers, since all relevant
information is present in the editor.  
</P>
<P>There are several common user actions that are available in edit
dialogs.  For example, hitting return while the cursor is positioned
in the name field of the editor commits the concept.  Most editors
contain commit and cancel buttons at the bottom which can be used to
either commit or abort edits.  Lists of items commonly have a + and &ndash;
button at the top of the lists, which repsectively mean add a new
item, and delete the selected item.  When the + button is pressed,
either a chooser dialog (see the Choosers section) or a specialized
editor will be opened.  Like the browser, list items can be
right-clicked to display a list of possible actions.  For example, a
superconcept can be clicked in a concept editor to immediately edit
the concept's parent.</P>
<P>Each type of object has a specialized editor.  For example, an
instance editor is shown in Figure 3.  There are separate editors for
modules, concepts, relations, instances, and propositions/rules,
which are described in turn below.  
</P>
<P><SPAN ID="Frame3" STYLE="float: left; width: 14.57cm; height: 15.05cm; border: none; padding: 0cm; background: #ffffff">
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm"><IMG SRC="./Powerloom GUI User's Guide_html_444e8f35.gif" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=100% BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Figure
	3  Instance Editor</I></FONT></P>
</SPAN><BR><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Module Editor</H3>
<P>The module editor contains a number of fields and components used
to enter information relevant for a new or existing module.  Examples
of values that can be edited are a module's name, a module's
documentation, and a module's includes list.  
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Concept Editor</H3>
<P>The concept editor allows editing of concept attributes such as a
concept's supertypes, it's name, it's associated propositions, etc. 
In addition to the inherent attributes of a concept, all relations
which have the concept as a domain type are displayed and may be
edited.  Clicking the + button above the relation list opens a new
relation editor, with default values filled in.  Similarly, clicking
the + button above the proposition list opens a proposition editor.  
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Relation Editor</H3>
<P>The relation editor allows the user to input a list of variables
and types for the relation's arguments, and allows the user to set
various attributes for a relation, such as whether the relation is
closed, functional, etc.  Like the concept editor, propositions and
rules associated with the relation can be edited.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Instance Editor</H3>
<P>The instance editor allows the user to input an instance's name,
documentation, and associated propositions.  If a proposition uses
the relation image-url, an image will be retrieved from the server
and presented in the editor window. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Proposition editor</H3>
<P>The proposition editor, shown in Figure 4, consists of a text
field for entering the proposition, and a set of buttons for
performing actions on the proposition.  The buttons allow a user to
assert, deny, or retract the typed proposition.  There are several
text-based facilities which support efficient editing of
propositions.  First, the editor supports many Emacs-style
keybindings which facilitate editing of lisp-like expressions,
including selecting entire parenthesis-delimited subexpressions,
jumping backward and forward over subexpressions, and navigating up
and down expression trees.</P>
<P><SPAN ID="Frame4" STYLE="float: left; width: 11.68cm; height: 6.48cm; border: none; padding: 0cm; background: #ffffff">
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm"><IMG SRC="./Powerloom GUI User's Guide_html_2b9b71ae.gif" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=100% BORDER=0><FONT SIZE=2><I>Figure
	4  Proposition Editor</I></FONT></P>
</SPAN><BR CLEAR=LEFT>In addition to Emacs keybindings, the
proposition editor has a matching parenthesis highlighter.  When the
cursor is placed before a left parenthesis, the matching right
parenthesis is is highlighted, and when the cursor is placed after 
right parenthesis, the matching left parenthesis is highlighted.
</P>
<P>The proposition editor also has support for symbol completion. 
The GUI uses a predictive backtracking parser to analyze partial
input of propositions.  Based on the analysis, the parser is able to
recommend appropriate completions.  For example, if the user types <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">(f</FONT>
and then selects the completion action, the parser will recommend a
list of completions including the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">forall</FONT>
symbol and all concepts and relations that begin with the letter f.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Choosers</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In a number of situations, an object of
a specific type must be selected.  For example, when selecting a
superconcept in a concept editor, the user should be presented with a
list of existing concepts.  In these cases, a chooser dialog is
presented to the user which displays a filterable list of candidate
objects.  As the user types a name of the object in the name text
field, the list of objects is filtered so that only objects which
begin with the typed prefix are displayed.  Choosers are available
for modules,     concept, instances, and relations.  A variable
chooser allows the user to type a variable name and select a type
from a concept from a list.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Extension Editor</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The extension editor, shown in Figure
5, allows editing of a concept or relation's extension, and can be
opened by right-clicking on a concept or relation in the browser or
by selecting the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">Query -&gt; Edit
</FONT>Extension menu item.  The extension editor presents a
relation's extension as a list of tuples in table format.  The user
may add new tuples by typing names of instances at the bottom of the
table, and may alter existing tuples but double-clicking on a table
cell and typing in a new value.  Instance name completion is
available while typing instance names by typing <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">CTRL
&ndash; [right arrow]</FONT>.  A user may choose to abort the edited
extension by clicking the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">Cancel</FONT>
button.  If the user clicks the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">Commit
</FONT>button, the relation's extension will be updated by asserting
and retracting appropriate propositions.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Query/Ask</H2>
<P>The Query dialog, shown in Figure 6, can be opened by selecting
the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">Query -&gt; Query </FONT>menu
item, typing <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">CTRL-Q </FONT>or by
pressing the query toolbar button.  The Query dialog consists of a
text area for typing the query, a results table for displaying the
results of the query, a query list for selecting pre-saved queries,
and an options subpane for configuring various query parameters.  
</P>

</SPAN><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The query input pane supports features similar to that of the
proposition editor, including Emacs keybindings, parenthesis
matching, and completion.  Queries can be executed by hitting
<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">CTRL-[RETURN]</FONT> or by clicking
on the Execute button at the bottom of the dialog.  After a query has
executed, results will be displayed in the results table or a &ldquo;No
results found&rdquo; indicator will flash in the results area.  The
column headers for the results will display the corresponding free
variables in the query.  Results may be sorted by clicking on a
column header.  Doing so will sort the results by using the clicked
column as an index.  Users may toggle ascending/descending sort order
by clicking the header multiple times.</P>
<P>If the query contains no free variables, it is effectively an ASK
operation (as opposed to a RETRIEVE operation).  In this case, the
result will be a truth value, and the column header will be labeld
<FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">TRUTH-VALUE</FONT>.  If the query is
the result of a partial retrieve operation, an additional column
containing the match score wil be displayed.</P>
<P>If the user clicks on a cell in the results table, the topmost
browser will be updated to display the selected item.  For cases
where a partial query was performed, the user may right-click on a
query result and select the &ldquo;Show Explanation&rdquo; menu item.
 Selecting this will present an HTML explanation in a separate
window.  The displayed explanation may contain hyperlinked objects. 
Clicking on a hyperlinked object will update the topmost browser to
display the object.</P>
<P>Users may save frequently-executed queries in a query list by
clicking the Save button at the top of the options panel.  After
clicking save, they will be prompted for a query name.  Saved queries
will be stored in the preferences file and are represented as XML. 
Saved queries are stored in the combobox to the left of the save
button.  Selection of a saved query will prefill the Query dialog
with the query and all saved parameters.</P>
<P>All PowerLoom query options are available in the options dialog. 
These options currently include the query's timeout, moveout, maximum
number of unknowns, minimum score, and match mode.

<H2 CLASS="western">Search</H2>

	7  Search Dialog</I></FONT></P>
</SPAN><BR CLEAR=LEFT>Users may search by for objects in the KB by
entering strings which match the name of the object.  A search dialog
as shown in Figure 7 can be opened by selecting the Query -&gt;
Search menu item, typing CTRL-F, or by pushing a search toolbar
button inside the browser.  If the user pushes a search toolbar
button inside a navigation pane, the search dialog will be configured
to search for objects associated with the type of object displayed in
the pane.  For example pushing the search button inside the concept
navigation pane will configure the search dialog to look for concept
objects.  
</P>
<P>Searches may be constrained in several ways.  First, the type of
module may be specified or the user may specify that the search
should be across all modules.  Second, the types of objects to be
searched is configurable.  For example, users may search for concepts
and instances, instances only, etc.  Finally, users may specify that
the objects name must match the beginning or end of the search
string, or exactly match the search string.</P>
<P>When the user executes the search by hitting return or selecting
the OK button, a list of results is presented.  These results are
presented in table format, where one column is the name of the
retrieved object, another column contains the module that the object
resides in, and the final column specifies the type of the object
(i.e., concept, instance, etc).  As is the case with query results,
clicking on a search result item will update the topmost browser to
display the selected object.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Console</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The console window, as shown in Figure
8, can be opened by selecting the <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">KB
-&gt; Open PowerLoom Console</FONT> menu item or typing <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">CTRL-P</FONT>.
 This opens an internal window which allows PowerLoom commands to be
typed directly and sent to the PowerLoom server.  The response
generated by PowerLoom is sent back to the GUI and printed below the
prompt.  This functionality is similar to that of a LISP listener.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete</H2>
<P>The PowerLoom GUI supports Cut, Copy, Paste, and Delete
operations.   These operations can be used to edit text, and in some
cases they can be used to edit objects in list or trees.  For
example, the concept hierarchy can be edited within the browser by
selecting a concept, executing a cut operation, selecting another
concept, and then executing paste.  This sequence of operations will
delete the concept from it's original position in the hierarchy, and
make it a subconcept of the concept that was selected when the paste
operation was performed.   
</P>
<P>We have implemented a robust data transfer framework which is
capable of recognizing the types of objects that are being
transferred, and the types of potential transfer sources and
destinations.  This allows the application to prohibit nonsensical
data transfers such as cutting a concept in a concept navigation pane
and then trying to paste it a module pane.   It also allows data
transfer operations to be context sensitive.  For example, cutting a
concept in a concept navigation pane means that a move operation is
being initiated, while cutting a concept in a concept editor's
superconcept list means that the concept should be removed from the
list.  Additionally, copying an object such as a concept, then
executing a paste inside a text window will paste the name of the
object.</P>
<P>As one would expect, text may be cut/copied/pasted between the GUI
and outside applications.</P>
