     GUI client for the Powerloom&reg; Knowledge Representation and Reasoning System.

    <h2>Coding Conventions, Techniques, Patterns and Frameworks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Frames and Panels -</b>Internal frames such as editors
	  normally contain the high-level public API that the rest of
	  the application uses to get/set frame data.  For example,
	  the concept editor <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/ConceptFrame2.html">ConceptFrame</a>
          contains the method <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/ConceptFrame2.html#setConcept(edu.isi.powerloom.gui.xmlobject.PLModule, edu.isi.powerloom.gui.xmlobject.PLConcept)">setConcept</a>
          which is responsible for initializing the editor with a 
          <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/../xmlobject/PLConcept.html">PLConcept</a>'s data. 
          If a frame is sufficiently complex, it may have an
	  associated panel which manages the internal frame
	  components.  For example, <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/ConceptFrame2.html">ConceptFrame</a> 
	  has an associated <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/ConceptPanel2.html">ConceptPanel</a>.
	All Internal Frames should inherit from <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PLFrame.html">PLFrame</a>.
	This base class provides services such as edit listener management,
	window list management, clipboard management, open/close actions,  positioning, etc.</li>

      <li><b>Cut & paste framework - </b>The cut/copy/delete/paste
      framework consists
      of the classes <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/DataTransferInfo.html">DataTransferInfo</a>,
      <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/DataTransferManager.html">DataTransferManager</a>,
      <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/DataTransferRecord.html">DataTransferRecord</a>,
      <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PLClipboardOwner.html">PLClipboardOwner</a>,
      <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PLClipboardOwnerParent.html">PLClipboardOwnerParent</a>,
      <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PLClipboardOwnerSupport.html">PLClipboardOwnerSupport</a>,
      <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PLClipboardOwnerTable.html">PLClipboardOwnerTable</a>, and
      <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PLClipboardRecord.html">PLClipboardRecord</a>.
      See these classes for more details. </li>
      <li><b>Adding a new internal frame - </b>To add a new interal
	frame, you must first design the GUI.  You can use a GUI editor
	such as Forte to create the layout for the internal components
	of the frame.  Be sure that the frame subclasses 
	<a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PLFrame.html">PLFrame</a>. Then
	add code for the component actions and GUI logic, and if
	necessary, add code in 
	<a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PowerloomApp.html">PowerloomApp</a> 
	for a menu item to open the frame.</li>
      <li><b>GUI updates -</b>Components which modify the KB, such as the Concept Editor should
	fire a <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PLEditEvent.html">PLEditEvent</a> event, 
	filling in appropriate event fields such
	as the type of edit that was performed.  Components which are
	interested in receiving updates when edits occur (such as 
	<a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PowerloomTrees.html">PowerloomTrees</a>) should 
	implement a performEdit method, which contains code to update
	the display.  For an example of firing an edit event, see 
	<a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/ConceptFrame2.html#commitConcept()">ConceptFrame.commitMethod()</a>.
	For an example of performing GUI updates after an edit event has been fired, see
	<a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/PowerloomTrees.html#performEdit(edu.isi.powerloom.gui.components.PLEditEvent)">PowerloomTrees.performEdit()</a>.</li>
      <li><b>Value Objects - </b>Objects which hold data (aka <i>Value
	  Objects</i>) such as concepts, relations, etc. should be
	instantiated from classes that extend 
	<a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/xmlobject/XMLObject.html">XMLObject</a>.  
	These objects are capable of being marshaled and unmarshaled to and from XML via the 
	<a href="http://www.castor.org">Castor</a> framework. This facilitates client/webservice communication
	via SOAP or other XML-based protocols.</li>
      <li><b>Data access layer - </b>The GUI client communicates with Powerloom via a <i>Data Access Layer</i>. 
	  This layer is responsible for communicating with Powerloom and caching data.
	  The data access layer consists of the 
	  <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/serverinterface/KnowledgeManager.html">KnowledgeManager</a>, 
	  <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/serverinterface/ServerInterface.html">ServerInterface</a>, and 
	  <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/serverinterface/SoapSender.html">SoapSender</a> classes.  These and other 
	helper classes reside in the <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/serverinterface/package-summary.html">serverinterface</a> package.</li>
      <li><b>Ensuring a subcomponent has focus - </b>It is
      sometimes desirable to set the focus to a subcomponent within an
      internal frame.  For example, when a Concept Editor is opened,
      the Concept Name text field should get the focus.  However,
      calling requestFocus() generally doesn't work when it called by the
      same object that created the window.  One trick that seems to
      work is to add a focus listener to the internal frame, and add a
      call to subComponent.requestFocus() in the gainedFocus() of the
      listener.  For an example, see the code in
      <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/components/ConceptFrame2.html#initialize()">ConceptFrame.initialize()</a>.
      </li>
    
      <li><b>Adding new server method - </b>To add a new remote API method, execute
	the following steps: 
	<ol>
	  <li>Add any appropriate xml objects in stella on the server side.  See 
	    powerloom-server/xml-objects.ste for examples.</li>
	  <li>Implement the new function in stella.  By convenntion, all 
	    server API methods begin with the prefix SERVER- and reside
	    in the POWERLOOM-SERVER module.</li>
	  <li>Write a function to test the method.  By default, test functions
	    should have the same name as the function as they are testing, and be
	    prefixed with "TEST-".</li>
	  <li>Add the API method to the *SERVER-DISPATCH-TABLE* using code such as the following:
	    <code>(INSERT-AT *SERVER-DISPATCH-TABLE* "SERVER-&lt;newfunctionName&gt;" (THE-CODE :FUNCTION SERVER-&lt;newFunctionName&gt;))</code>, where <code>&lt;newFunctionName&gt;</code> is the name of the API function you implemented.  See
	    powerloom-server/server-interface.ste for examples.</li>
	  <li>Add the equivalent Java XML objects in the package 
	    <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/xmlobject/package-summary.html">edu.isi.powerloom.gui.xmlobject</a></li>
	<li>Add an entry in the castor mapping file which describes the new Java XML object.  See
	    powerloom-gui/resources/conf/castor-mapping.xml.</li>
	  <li>Add the Java method signature in the file <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/serverinterface/ServerInterface.html">ServerInterface</a>.</li>
	  <li>Add a Java implementation for the method.  The remote version of the implementation
	    should go in <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/serverinterface/RemoteServerImpl.html">RemoteServerImpl</a>, 
	    and should contain code to execute the remote call.  See
	    this file for examples on writing the correct RPC code.</li>
	  <li>The in-process version of the GUI has not yet been implemented.  Hence, you will need
	    to write a dummy implementation for the method in 
	    <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/serverinterface/LocalServerImpl.html">LocalServerImpl</a> 
	    which does nothing.</li>
	  <li>Write a method in the 
	    <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/serverinterface/KnowledgeManager.html">KnowledgeManager</a> 
	    class which calls the API
	    method you defined in 
	    <a href="edu/isi/powerloom/gui/serverinterface/ServerInterface.html">ServerInterface</a>.  
	    This method should do any 
	    necessary conversion of Java data types to XML Objects (e.g., Strings to PLStrings, 
	    booleans to PLStrings, etc), and if necessary, provide caching support.</li>
	  <li>Your method is now (finally!) ready to be called by the GUI application.
	</ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
