    "Value Object" classes used for holding data used by the application.  Classes which
    extend XMLObject are capable of marshaling and unmarshaling XML data. <p>

      By convention, all fields which represent XML attributes
      should be prefixed with "attr", and all fields which represent
      XML elements should be prefixed with "elem".  In addition,
      collections of elements should be named according to the type of
      object they contain.  For example, a list of PLConcepts should be
      named "elemPLConcept".  This naming restriction will likely be
      removed in future releases.<p>
