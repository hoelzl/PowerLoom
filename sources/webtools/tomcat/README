		   INSTALLING ONTOSAURUS IN TOMCAT

Document version: README,v 1.8 2009/08/27 21:27:41 tar Exp

To install the Ontosaurus servlet for Tomcat (and other compatible Web
servers), you will need to modify some of the files for your own
particular configuration and move them to the appropriate place in
the Tomcat directory hierarchy.  For simplicity we assume that the
OntosaurusServlet will be installed in Tomcat's webapps directory.

INSTALLATION.

There are a number of files that must be installed to support
Ontosaurus under Tomcat.  The distribution WAR file for ontosaurus
tomcat can be just added to the Tomcat webapps directory and it will
automatically be uncompressed and installed with the files in the
correct places.

** NOTE THAT IF YOU HAVE CUSTOMIZATIONS, YOU WILL NEED TO SAVE
   THEM BEFORE INSTALLING A NEW RELEASE OR THEY WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.


The following will be installed:

  webapps
    ploom                         % Directory with documents
                                  %   needed by Ontosaurus
    ploom/INSTALL-Ontosaurus.text % This document
    ploom/WEB-INF/lib             % PowerLoom, plsoap and ontosaurus
                                  %   jar files
    ploom/WEB-INF/web.xml         % Webapp file.
                                  % NEEDS CUSTOMIZATION!
    ploom/WEB-INF/web-basic.xml   % Plain ontosaurus webapp
    ploom/WEB-INF/web-full.xml    % Ontoasurus + webservice webapp

    ploom/kbs/  		  % Directory with example kbs
                                  %   or production kbs.

If the SOAP server is also included, then there will be two additional
files at the top level an additional jar file in the ploom/WEB-INF/lib
directory.

    ploom/plsoap.wsdl	          % WSDL description of SOAP Server
    ploom/plsoap-readonly.wsdl    % WSDL for Read only SOAP Server



CUSTOMIZATION.

The only item that will require customization is the "web.xml" file
and the addition of user PowerLoom files to the "kbs" subdirectory.
If the SOAP server is included, the service location in the wsdl files
may need to be updated as well.  There are two files that are
provided.  "web-basic.xml" is for a plain Ontosaurus server.


All customization in "web.xml" is handled by setting values of
initialization parameters in that file.  The key parameters are the
following:

  SystemInits Whitespace separated list of Stella/PowerLoom system
              initialization code to call.  This must be the fully
              qualified name to invoke with no parameters.  Encoding of
              whitespace and other unusual characters is like in URLs.
              This need only be set if additional PowerLoom or Stella
              code is being used by your system.  For a plain
              PowerLoom installation, this can be blank.

  KBHome      Path to the top of the KB (knowledge base) directory.
              Must end with a directory separator character.  Encoding of
              whitespace and other unusual characters is like in URLs.
	      This is either an absolute path, or a path relative to
              the powerloom/htdocs/ontosaurus directory.  The default
	      value is the kbs/ directory.  This must be set correctly
              for the loading of KBs (see next entry), but the default
              will work if any KBs to be loaded are placed there.
     
  KBs         Whitespace separated list of paths (relative to kbhome)
              of knowledge bases to load.  They will be loaded after
              any additional systems are initialized.    Encoding of
              whitespace and other unusual characters is like in URLs.
	      These KBs will be loaded after any system initialization
	      code is run.  The KBs will be loaded in the order listed.

	 The following two items are optional and only need be
         specified if you want to support graphical viewing or
         browsing of the knowledge bases in Ontosaurus.  Currently
         this only works on Unix systems.  The graphics are rendered
         by an external program GraphViz program also known as "dot"
	 (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/).  This must
         be installed on your system in order to have this function.
         Files are written to a temporary directory, which will have
         to be cleaned periodically.  Ontosaurus does not do this
         cleaning.

  dot         Path to executable for dot graphing program.

  tempDir     Path to temporary directory for graphs.  Must end with
              a directory separator character.  Default value is the
              system property java.io.tempdir, which Tomcat sets
              reasonably.

If there is additional Stella or PowerLoom code that is being run,
then jar files with the appropriate code will also need to be added to
the ploom/WEB-INF/lib/ directory, along with the PowerLoom.jar and
Ontosaurus.jar files.
