;;; - Need to inform the AREF walker to translate into these accessors if indicated.
;;;   Think about that some more, this would mean that we'd lose some of the
;;;   dimensionality checking at translation time, since the walker would translate
;;;   into 1d-aref, 2d-aref, etc. depending on how many dimensions were supplied,
;;;   which could lead to strange bugs if one forgot to include a dimension.
;;; - update neural-network.ste to use the new array data structures

;;; This is an attempt to have multidimensional arrays in STELLA that can be fully
;;; dynamic, i.e., where none of their dimensions has to be known at translation
;;; time.  In Lisp and Java this is already supported, but for C++ we can only leave
;;; one dimension open.  The current ARRAY data type caters to this lowest common
;;; denominator which gives us maximum native array access speed.  However, it seems
;;; very uncommon to have multidimensional arrays where one dimension can be fixed,
;;; and the workarounds are kind of ugly (e.g., use a vector of vectors often with
;;; wrapped element types).  So here we have a STELLA type implementation that does
;;; the trick.  Actually, it is kind of nifty and might become a template for other
;;; similar situations, where we specify a set of template operations with an
;;; UNKNOWN value type on a mixin class and then instantiate that class multiple
;;; times with different element types.  The inheriting down of mixin methods then
;;; gives us the equivalent of template instantiation and allows us to easily handle
;;; literal element types such as float or integer without wrapping.

;;; Alternatively, we could try to write some native support in C++ (or as Tom
;;; suggested use some existing C++ array library) and simply wrap this functionality
;;; in STELLA.  This would most definitely require template syntax in C++ (or we'd
;;; have to work with void pointers and casting); additionally, if we ever go this
;;; route, we'd want to ensure that the resulting type is a subtype of OBJECT, so
;;; we can easily stick it into other containers.  What we have here for now was
;;; easier and also still gives us the option of maximum access speed on the native
;;; array without any address arithmetic.
