Log Message:
all-functions-next?:
  Use new `lookup-function-home-module' to do prefiltering, since
  checking the symbol module doesn't always do the right thing (e.g.,
  if we inherited the name symbol), and calling `lookup-function' on
  all entries to check their `home-module' would expand all the stubs.
  This fixes a bug with the PowerLoom `help' command.

Log Message:
cpp-yield-main-file-name:
  New definition to support writing the `main' function to a separate

cpp-output-main:
  Changed to write the `main' function to a separate file.  With
  multiple systems static linking complains about duplicate definitions
  of `main'.  By having it in its own file we can selectively link the
  proper main function for the top-level system.

cpp-yield-SYSTEMS-ROOT-directory, cpp-yield-STELLA-ROOT-directory:
  New functions to support generation of proper relative pathnames for
  the corresponding Makefile template variables.  This avoids
  hardcoding the pathname valid at translation time which prevents us
  from moving the translated system to a different location without
  breaking the `make' process.

cpp-yield-STELLA-ROOT-directory:

defdemon:
  Added :lisp-macro? annotation.  This will allow us to simplify the
  handling of macro-expansion functions.  The reason why they are
  currently in a separate table with an `-expander' suffix is to not
  make them clash with lisp macros such as stella::defdemon.  However,
  the introduction of commands added support to handle that gracefully.

Update of /nfs/image2/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/stella
In directory redhouse:/home/hans/Projects/powerloom/sources/stella

Modified Files:
	walk.ste 
Log Message:
Streamlined implementation of macros to make them more similar to
regular functions (motivated by the STELLA manual effort):
- No more specialized `*macro-table*'.
- Macros are now found in the regular `*function-lookup-table*'.
- The name of the expander function is identical with the macro name.
- The only things that's different about them is that they have a
  `method-macro?' annotation to identify them as macros.

print-translation-unit, walk-phase-one-unit:
  Removed `MACRO' case.

print-error-context:
  Adapted to new macro representation scheme (we have to test on the
  slot object instead of the translation unit).

walk-typecase-tree:
  Fixed: don't generate casting code if the expression is a global
  variable.

walk-call-slot-tree:
  Slightly changed macro handling for performance reasons, due to the
  new macro implementation scheme.

*macro-table*, store-macro, undefine-macro, yield-macro-expander-function-name:
  Removed.

METHOD-SLOT.method-macro?:
  New dynamic slot.

walk-defmacro-tree:
  Adapted to new definition scheme.
  Improved error messages.
  Folded some of the error handling from `walk-macro-unit' into here.

walk-macro-unit:
  Removed.

Modified Files:
	methods.ste 
Log Message:
undefine-conflicting-definitions?:
  Kludged to use pre-existing macro function code in case of a macro
  redefinition.  This handles cases where a macro was minorly changed
  (e.g., its docstring) without having been reevaluated.  Without this
  kludge the macro becomes unusable, since its old method object gets
  replaced by a new one whose function code slot hasn't been
  initialized.  In case of a real redefinition, the macro has to be
  recompiled anyway which will properly reset that slot to the new
  expander function.

stella-version-string:
  New function that allows us to print version information before any
  startup code is run (`*stella-version-string*' doesn't get
  initialized until the :globals phase).

startup:
  Removed printing of version info, since that's now done in `main'.

interpret-command-line-arguments:
  New function to handle the new `-e' or `-eval' options (more to come
  soon).

defmain:
  Added `count' and `arguments' to allow command line argument
  processing.
  Now prints verbose messages only if there are no command line
  arguments.
  Make sure we call `startup-stella-system' so that the function
  object of `startup-stella-system' gets defined.

Log Message:
quote-arguments:
  Use 'quote' to quote argument trees instead of `bquote' so we can
  have &'s without breaking.  Copy them with an explicit copy
  operation so destructive modification is ok.

walk-exception-handler-trees:
  Fixed: walk the exception variable declaration outside the `bquote',
  so we can be sure the variable is pushed on the stack before any body
  trees are walked.  Necessary, since in C++ we can not rely on argument
  evaluation order.

coerce-evaluated-tree:
  Improved: handle coercion of constants such as TRUE or FALSE that
  have already been converted to wrappers by `evaluate-atomic-tree'.
  Needed so we can properly evaluate commands such as `MAKE-SYSTEM'.

Log Message:
native-name?:
  Generalized to accept a NULL category (meaning "any").

yield-renamed-name-if-native:
  Changed for C++ to never do any renaming, since now we can achieve
  this effect by explicitly qualifying the STELLA function with the appropriate
  namespace prefix.

Register `round' as a :cpp native name to avoid clash with the STL

make-raw-mutable-string:
  Fixed: make sure we have a terminating null character in C++ (not
  sure why this didn't show up before, probably because string were 0-ed
  out when they were allocated).

free-hash-table-values:
  Qualify C++ stream constants.

STRING.hash-code:
  Implement in C++ via new `native-hash-code'.  This was done as part

  Eliminate `consume-whitespace' in favor of explicit whitespace
  skipping, since if we are in :line buffering mode to collect white
  space we do not get the right results (since we effectively need two
  newlines to first read the whitespace and then the input - again, not
  sure how that ever worked).

  Kludged around a problem with the g++ 3.2 implementation of

  Added missing type declaration for `eofP' variable (used to be a

probeFileP:
  Properly qualified std C++ stream data types.
  Fixed test for file existence, since `bad()' doesn't seem to do the

  worry once about the implementation of this type of test.

Update of /nfs/image2/loom/CVS-Repository/powerloom/sources/stella
In directory redhouse:/home/hans/Projects/powerloom/sources/stella

Modified Files:
	translate-file.ste 
Log Message:
file-name-directory:
  Improved to consistently include a logical host part with the directory.
  For example:
     (file-name-directory "PL:bar;foo.c") => "PL:bar;" ;; that's what it was
     (file-name-directory "PL:foo.c") => "PL:" ;; now consistent with above

file-name-without-directory:
  Fixed to make sure we always remove a logical host portion even if
  there wasn't a directory, e.g., for "PL:foo.c".

merge-file-names:
  New function.

Modified Files:
	lists.ste 
Log Message:
LIST.copy:
  Slightly improved by special-casing a copy of the LIST type.  We
  only call the more expensive generic `create-object' if we deal with a
  subtype of LIST.

Modified Files:

Log Message:
SET.ordered?:
  New method.

Completely revamped SET implementation by basing it on `LIST', since
most of the `LIST' methods should be inherited.  The following methods
are overridden to ensure set semantics:

SET.{insert, push, insert-last, substitute, concatenate}:
  New methods to override LIST versions.

SET.object-equal?:
  New equality test for SETs.

SET.equal-hash-code:
  New `equal?' hash method.

set:
  New variable-arg constructor.

VECTOR.equal-hash-code:
  New `equal?' hash method.

STELLA-HASH-TABLE:
  New `equal-test?' slot to indicate whether an `equal?' test should
  be used to compare elements.

make-stella-hash-table:
  Replaced by shadowing `STELLA-HASH-TABLE.initialize-hash-table'
  method.

rehash-stella-hash-table, stella-hash-table-insert-at,
stella-hash-table-remove-at, stella-hash-table-lookup:
  Support new `equal?' tests and hashing.

STELLA-HASH-TABLE.{length, empty?, non-empty?, copy, clear, consify,
object-equal?, equal-hash-code}:
  New methods.

STELLA-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR:
  New iterator class to support iteration over STELLA-HASH-TABLE's.

STELLA-HASH-TABLE.allocate-iterator,
STELLA-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR.{next?, value-setter, key-setter}:
  New methods.

*key-value-map-crossover-point*:
  New global.

KEY-VALUE-MAP:
  New full-featured dictionary class.

KEY-VALUE-MAP.{lookup, insert-at, remove-at, length, empty?
non-empty?, copy, clear, allocate-iterator, consify, object-equal?,
equal-hash-code}:
  New methods.

HASH-SET:
  New full-featured set class.

hash-set:
  New function.

HASH-SET.{member?, insert, remove, remove-if, pop, substitute, copy,
consify, subset?, equivalent-sets?, intersection, union, difference,
subtract, object-equal?, equal-hash-code}:

Modified Files:
	hierarchy.ste 
Log Message:
SET-ITERATOR:
  Removed, since obsolete (now handled by LIST-ITERATOR).

TYPES-TO-CLASSES-ITERATOR:
  Use `(slot-value self value)' idiom in `next?' method for safety, so
  we won't have problems if a `value-setter' method is implemented.
  These changes were necessitated by the definition of an abstract
  `value-setter' method on ABSTRACT-ITERATOR.  The method was later
  moved down to ABSTRACT-DICTIONARY-ITERATOR to have a smaller chance
  of affecting unsuspecting legacy code.  That in turn made the change
  not mandatory anymore, but we keep it anyway, since it's the right
  thing to do.

ABSTRACT-DICTIONARY-ITERATOR.{value-setter, key-setter}:
  Added: otherwise, (setf (key/value it) ...) statements won't be
  translated right if the type of `it' is an abstract iterator class.
  These should go onto ABSTRACT-ITERATOR, however, there it
  potentially affects too much old code.

LIST, PROPERTY-LIST:
  Fixed print-form to use `print-cons' to obey new `*printLength*' special.
  Also changed prefixes just for the heck of it.

SET:
  Now a subclass of LIST, since most of LIST's operations should be
  inherited (what was strange that LIST's had various set manipulations
  implemented, but SET's didn't).

Modified Files:
	cl-translate.ste 
Log Message:
cl-translate-local-symbol:
  Fixed to preserve case if we are in a case-sensitive module (similar
  to what we do for global symbols).

yield-struct-slot-tree:
  Fixed: don't translate the slot name as a global symbol, since it
  gets concatenated with the struct prefix which in turn does get
  treated as a global symbol (i.e., gets any necessary prefixes
  attached in case the module isn't associated with a package - such as
  PL-KERNEL).  If it did get treated as a global symbol, we would (and
  did) create inconsitent translations between the struct definition
  and access forms.  This was exhibited by the INTERVAL-CACHE class in
  PowerLoom.

Modified Files:
	foreach.ste 
Log Message:
The primary purpose of this change set is to generalize processing of
IN-cursor clauses to separate value assignment clauses from iterator
bump clauses.  This in turn lets us translate FOREACH loops into `for'
loops in C++ and Java.  This was motivated by the need to generate
more stream-lined & optimized C++ translations of STELLA loops for the
PIM+KDD project.

walk-foreach-tree:
  Disabled SETOF processing.  This feature is as yet unused and seems
  a bit too esotheric to warrant its update to the new foreach clause
  processing and representation.

walk-collection-tree:
  Fixed: don't lose complex anchored types, etc. during rewalking by
  exactly remembering the type of the collection.

yield-IN-cursor-clauses,
yield-IN-cursor-clauses-for-general-collection,
yield-IN-cursor-clauses-for-INTEGER-INTERVAL,

collect-cursor-clauses, walk-cursors-tree,
walk-prefix-collect-into-tree, walk-prefix-foreach-body,
walk-prefix-foreach-tree:
  Adapted to new IN-clause processing.

*aggressively-optimize-interval-foreach?*,
yield-optimized-IN-cursor-clauses-for-INTEGER-INTERVAL:
  New support for more aggressive optimization of INTERVAL iteration.
  Used for selectively C++-translating some code that warrants these
  optimizations (e.g., for our PIM+KNOW work).

extract-setof-nested-iterator-tree, walk-setof-tree, 
walk-prefix-foreach-tree:
  Disabled for now (since unused and esotheric) and not yet adapted to
  the new scheme.

Log Message:
Made file handling more robust through use of WITH-OUTPUT-FILE macro.
Also added code to detect a rare, but hard to debug situation where the
flotsam file gets clobbered when the same flotsam file is specified
for multiple modules in the same directory in the same system.

In directory blackcat.isi.edu:/tmp/cvs-serv26027/stella

Modified Files:
	date-time-parser.ste 
Log Message:
Numerous changes to parsing.  The major highlights are the addition of
an explicit default values parameter, which makes the parsing code now
be non-destructive, and allows YESTERDAY, TODAY, TOMORROW, and NOW to
implement a more clever filling-in of default values when partial
specifications in the input string exist and a default is present.

Added a merging control flag to the date time parsing routines and
solved the follow-on issues from that.

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Renamed RELATIVE-STRING-TO-CALENDAR-DATE to
			     STRING-TO-CALENDAR-DATE-WITH-DEFAULT

Also, the patterns were enhanced with more optional features to expand
coverage and also allow parsing of ISO 8601 strings which are time only.

Modified Files:
	date-time.ste 
Log Message:
Added functions:
   TIME-ZONE-FORMAT60 to format time zones in +/-hh:mm format.
   DECODED-DATE-TIME-TO-ISO8601-STRING
   SET-CONSISTENT-DOW to make sure the day of week is OK
   HELP-MERGE-NULL-FIELDS helper for various merging strategies
   MERGE-NULL-FIELDS merges all null fields in decoded date-time
   MERGE-SUPERIOR-NULL-FIELDS merges only those null fields that
       are larger time units than smallest filled-in field.
   CALENDAR-DATE-TO-ISO8601-STRING

Changed these functions to methods.  Nicer Java translation:
   SET-CURRENT-TIME, SET-CURRENT-DATE, SET-CURRENT-DATE-TIME,
   CALENDAR-DATE-TO-DATE-STRING, CALENDAR-DATE-TO-TIME-STRING,
   CALENDAR-DATE-TO-STRING, PRINT-CALENDAR-DATE, TIME-DURATION-TO-STRING
   PRINT-TIME-DURATION,

CALENDAR-DATE-TO-TIME-STRING had a millisecond display and a
    merge flag added to the input parameters.  INCOMPATIBLE!

Added constants with special values of DECODED-DATE-TIME
for efficiency purposes.
   *DEFAULT-DECODED-DATE-TIME*  Standard default values.
   *NULL-DECODED-DATE-TIME*     All null field values.

ENCODE-CALENDAR-DATE now performs a virtual merge with the default
   values when given input that has null fields.  Previously it
   needed all fields of the input parameter filled in.



Marked as constructor, to change Java class location assignment:
   STRING-TO-TIME-DURATION

  Fixed to handle systems that live deeper down in the hierarchy such

In directory redhouse:/home/hans/Projects/powerloom/sources/stella/cl-lib

Modified Files:
	cl-primal.ste 
Log Message:
cl-symbol-to-stella-symbol:
  New specialized function to parse Lisp symbols into STELLA symbols
  that combines functionality from the old `qualified-name?' as well as
  portions of `stella-code-to-cons-tree'.
  It (hopefully) improves case-conversion performance by not
  performing any upcasing anymore, which improves cases where we convert
  STELLA symbols such as `STELLA/|foo|' or simply `|foo|' which
  previously were upcased if the symbol module was case-insensitive.
  Note that case-conversion is now done relative to the current module
  (similar to the overall reader) as opposed to relative to the symbol
  module.

stella-code-to-cons-tree:
  Simplify symbol handling code with new `cl-symbol-to-stella-symbol'.

Log Message:
Modified the library code to list the libraries for ALL required systems
rather than just one level up.  This is required for the Mac OS X linker
and (I think) shouldn't hurt any others.  If it proves to be a problem,
then it can be conditionalized for Darwin systems.

Log Message:
*STELLA-BINARY-EXTENSION* robustness improvement, using the built-in
   pathname accessors rather than trying to parse strings.  String parsing

Modified Files:
	java-translate.ste 
Log Message:
CLASS-NAME-CONFLICTS-WITH-SLOT-NAME?:  Added to test for a slot name in
   a Java translated class hiding the name of a Java class.  This occurs
   extremely rarely, because of naming conventions, but it does happen in
   some of the XML handling code in webservices where slot names and types
   must match exactly to support parsing.
JAVA-TRANSLATE-TYPE-SPEC-HELPER:  Added to encapsulate code for normal
   handling of type specifier translation and the special translation for
   invoking static functions.  Only the latter need to check for slot name
   conflicts.  Controlled by a flag.
JAVA-TRANSLATE-TYPE-SPEC-FOR-FUNCTION:  Uses helper function.
JAVA-TRANSLATE-TYPE-SPEC:  Uses helper function now.  The helper function
   was introduced to avoid the need to patch a large number of other calls
   to this function.
JAVA-TRANSLATE-SYS-NEW:
JAVA-YIELD-CLASS-NAME-FOR-FUNCTION:
   Invokes the new translation for function type specs.

conditionalize this but the declarations should be consistent with any
pre-existing ones.

  Fixed by testing whether the STELLA system has already been started

  Updated to take an argument to determine if a readable name is
  needed.  This allows them to be used on both sides of the I/O

Modified Files:

Log Message:
evaluate-command:
  Also bind `*translationNotes*' so they don't leak.

Various changes to facilitate dynamic loading and startup of systems
in Java as well as streamlining of system functions.

define-system:
  Improved handling of required systems based on new
  *current-system-action* special.  This allows us to do the correct
  action for required systems when we do a load-system (for example in
  Java) where we don't want to trigger any retranslation.

lisp-keyword-to-stella-keyword:
  Removed since obsolete.

*current-system-action*:
  New special to communicate top-level actions and options to
  loading/making of required systems.

make-system:
  Made `language' argument optional and default to the native
  implementation language.
  Stream-lined option handling.
  Setup new `*current-system-action*' special.

system-loaded-or-started-up?:
  New function.

load-system:
  Improved similar to `make-system'.
  Don't restrict this to Lisp anymore, since we want to also be able
  to do it in Java (and eventually in C++).

run-system-startup-function:
  Generalized to also support Java by dynamically looking up a startup
  function and - if found - running it.

VECTOR-SEQUENCE.{empty?, non-empty?, length, last, last-setter}:
  New definitions.

VECTOR-SEQUENCE.insert:

CUSTOM-VECTOR-SEQUENCE.insert:
  New method.

copy-vector-sequence, VECTOR-SEQUENCE.copy, CUSTOM-VECTOR-SEQUENCE.copy:
  New definitions.

VECTOR-SEQUENCE.{clear, object-equal?}:

New support for sorting vectors and vector sequences.

VECTOR.sort, heap-sort-native-vector, heap-sort-heapify,
heap-sort-sift-down, quick-sort-pick-split-element,

Modified Files:
	cl-setup.lisp 
Log Message:
Various changes to make the CMUCL compiler happy (i.e., outsmart its
type inference to avoid unreachable code warnings, etc.)

clsys-safe-to-use-fast-CLOS-slot-value-p:
  Conditionalized for old versions of Allegro - this really is
  obsolete.

%%value:
  CMUCL was unhappy that in contexts where `x' was known to be a CONS
  (e.g., as a self variable in a method), it couldn't ever be NIL and
  therefore the second clause was unreachable.  The new formulation
  works around that issue.

%%open-network-stream, %make-process-lock, with-process-lock
  Fixed CMUCL conditionalization key.

%%simple-condition-format-control:
  Declared to make the CMUCL compiler happy.

*clsys-sxhash-supported-object-types*:
  Fixed type declaration, since it wouldn't allow a NIL value.

%%object-hash-code:
  Reformulated to avoid unreachable code warnings (similar reasons as
  with %%value).

Log Message:
cpp-non-pointer-type?, cpp-type-without-interior-pointers?:
  New support for detecting types that do not have any slots that
  point to objects that might need to be garbage collected.  This
  allows us to use a `PointerFreeGC' which can lead to vastly more
  efficient garbage collection (e.g., in KOJAK when we have large arrays
  of numbers, feature vectors, etc.)

cpp-translate-new-array, cpp-translate-make-tree:
  Support `PointerFreeGC' GC annotation.

	hierarchy.ste 
Log Message:
Various updates to support the new LONG-INTEGER type and to
streamline native number types.

All the number literal classes now have NUMBER as their supertype,
since, in C++ and Java they are really disjoint types.  For example,
int is not a subtype of long long int in C++.  This also better
matches the wrapper hierarchy, where all wrappers are/need to be
subtypes of NUMBER-WRAPPER.

Modified Files:
	primal.ste 
Log Message:
Various updates to support the new LONG-INTEGER type.

- Constants such as NULL-INTEGER and friends now use the
  std::numeric_limits idiom in C++ instead of the specialized
  hand-coded expressions used earlier.

- there are now boundary values for all the numeric types (see
  `print-numeric-constants').

- various functions such as `zero?', `plus?', etc. were converted into
  methods to also support long integers.  In C++ and Java these will
  be handled by overloaded functions;  In Lisp they are handled by
  actual methods which are implemented via `%%defintegermethod' (see
  cl-lib/cl-setup.lisp).

- `file-length' can now finally return a long integer.

Log Message:
Various improvements to type machinery and mixin method handling to

templates that take literal types as their parameters (as needed by
the new DIMENSIONAL-ARRAY classes).

walk-variable-arguments:
  Added `firstArgType' parameter.
  Fixed: deal with instantiation of an anchored variable arguments type;
  we need to know the first argument type in that case, since, for
  mixin methods, the owner type is generally not enough.

walk-inline-method-call:
  Added `firstArgType' parameter.
  Fixed: properly handle inlining of mixin methods where we need to
  use the type of the class this method was inherited down on to
  properly compute argument types.

walk-method-unit:
  Do generate startup code for general abstract mixin methods,
  otherwise, we can't translate anything later that depends on them.

create-mixin-method-units:
  Fixed: don't inherit methods that are overridden farther down.

get-current-self-type:
  New function.

Log Message:
Moved type-specific lisp NULL values from cl-lib/cl-primal.ste into
cl-lib/cl-setup.lisp so that they are available earlier.  Needed to
solve some boostrapping problems with SBCL's strict compiler.

Fixed bug in NULL value translation by the walker.  Now does array
NULL values appropriately for lisp.

Updated cross-reference documentation about this issus.

Modified Files:
	classes.ste 
Log Message:
unfinalize-class-slots:
  Fixed a problem with class unfinalization and caching of slot/method
  lookups.  The fix is to always call `clear-slot-and-method-cache' in
  `unfinalize-class-slots', even if the class is already unfinalized.
  Otherwise, for example, when `second-class-object.null?' gets defined,
  it unfinalizes the `array' class which is a subclass.  Shortly after,
  during definition of `array.null?' a lookup of `null?'  on `array'
  correctly yields `second-class-object.null?' which gets cached in
  `array's cache.  The problem is that when `array.null?' gets attached
  to its owner that cache then doesn't get cleared in
  `unfinalize-class-slots', since `array' is already unfinalized from
  before, which leaves the incorrect method in `array's cache together
  with the correct one.  Then it is just a matter of chance when the
  wrong one is picked up by accident from the cache.  This in turn
  fouled up proper inlining of `array.null?' in the Lisp translation
  generated by the C++ version of STELLA, since it would have the wrong
  owner class once in a while (`second-class-object' instead of
  `array').

  native versions of these functions.  This allowed us to add file
  existence/non-existence tests more uniformly (previously, these
  cases weren't handled right in C++).
  This could still be improved further, since the native versions of delete

  different across native languages (but it's too much work for now
  for what it's worth).
