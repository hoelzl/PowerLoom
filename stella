# Run the C++ or Java version of the STELLA programming language
# and translator under Unix
#
# Usage: stella [c++ | java] [{-e|--eval} STELLA-EXPRESSION [--batch]
#
# If the first argument is `c++' the C++ version of STELLA is run
# (if installed), if it is `java' the Java version is run (if
# installed); otherwise, if the C++ version is installed it will run
# that; if that is not installed, it will run the Java version.
#
# Example usage:
#
#    % stella -e '(make-system "hello-world" :cpp)'
