CAVEAT: Regular expressions are not yet supported in the PowerLoom
version of this browser.

<P> The "Find" button will look for matching items of the specified type.
If "<b>Exactly</b>" is selected in the "Match" pull down box, then the
name must be complete and the correct case.  If "<b>Case Insensitive</b>"
is chosen, then the name must be complete, but correct capitalization of
the letters is not important.  If "<b>Substring</b>" is chosen, then a
case insensitive match for all objects containing the search string is
made.

<P> If "<b>Wildcard</b>" is chosen, then the character "?" matches any
letter and the character "*" matches zero or more of any letter.  The
other letters are compared in a case insensitive manner.  Wildcard
matches must match the full object name, although the "*" operator can
be used to allow anything to match on the ends.

<P> If "<b>Regular Expression</b>" is chosen the names of objects are
matched to a regular expression in the type in box.  Letters are
compared in a case-insensitive manner.  Unlike wildcards, this regular
expression need only match a substring of the object name.  To force a
match against the whole object name the "^" and "$" operators must be
used.  <A HREF="#examples">Regular Expression Examples.</A>

<H3>Regular Expression Syntax</H3>

The following regular expression syntax is available:

<table WIDTH="100%" BORDER>
<TR ALIGN=center>
    <TH><b>Character</b></TH>
    <TH><b>Meaning</b></TH></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>^</TD>
    <TD>Beginning of string</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>$</TD>
    <TD>End of string</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>.</TD>
    <TD>(period) Matches any character</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>*</TD>
    <TD>Zero or more of the preceding element</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>+</TD>
    <TD>One or more of the preceding element</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>[...]</TD>
    <TD>Match any one of the elements in the square brackets.  A range
may be specified using the "-" (hyphen) character.  To include a hyphen
itself, it must be the first element inside the square brackets.  If the
first character is "^" (caret), then this inverts the sense of the
test&em;in other words the match is for anything except what is
specified in the square brackets.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>(...)</TD>
    <TD>Make the regular expression in parentheses act as a single
element.  Can also be referenced later.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>\<i>n</i></TD>
    <TD>Refer to the <i>n</i>th element in parentheses.  The first
element is number 1.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>\</TD>
    <TD>Escape character.  Used to enter any of the special regular
expression characters as its literal self.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>...</TD>
    <TD>There are more options</TD></TR>
